  "sn44.2:4.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. ",
  "sn44.2:4.2": "Now at that time Venerable Anurādha was staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut. ",
  "sn44.2:4.3": "Then several wanderers who follow other paths went up to Venerable Anurādha ",

  "sn44.2:4.5": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side",
  "sn44.2:4.6": "and said to him: ",
  "sn44.2:4.7": "“Reverend Anurādha, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them in these four ways: ",

  "sn44.2:4.11": "When he said this, the wanderers said to him:",
  "sn44.2:4.12": "“This mendicant must be junior, recently gone forth, or else a foolish, incompetent senior mendicant.”",
  "sn44.2:4.13": "Then, after rebuking Venerable Anurādha by calling him “junior” and “foolish”, the wanderers got up from their seat and left.",
  "sn44.2:5.1": "Soon after they had left, Anurādha thought:",
  "sn44.2:5.2": "“If those wanderers were to inquire further, how should I answer them so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should I explain in line with his teaching, so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?”",
