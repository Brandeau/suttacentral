  "sn22.82:4.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.",
  "sn22.82:4.2": "Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.",
  "sn22.82:5.1": "Then one of the mendicants got up from their seat, arranged their robe over one shoulder, raised their cupped palms toward the Buddha, and said:",
  "sn22.82:5.2": "“Sir, I’d like to ask the Buddha about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”",
  "sn22.82:5.3": "“Well then, mendicant, take your own seat and ask what you wish.”",
  "sn22.82:5.4": "“Yes, sir,” replied that mendicant. He took his seat and said to the Buddha:",

  "sn22.82:7.2": "“These five grasping aggregates are rooted in desire.” …",
  "sn22.82:7.3": "“But sir, is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates? Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another?”",
  "sn22.82:7.4": "“Neither. Rather, the desire and greed for them is the grasping there.” …",
  "sn22.82:7.5": "Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant … asked another question:",
