  "an6.42:4.7": "‘That Blessed One is perfect, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme trainer of people, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’",
  "an6.42:4.9": "He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.

  "an6.42:5.4": "“Sir, it’s these brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala. They’ve brought many different foods, and they’re standing outside the gates wanting to offer it specially to the Buddha and the mendicant Saṅgha.”",
  "an6.42:5.5": "“Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to me. ",
  "an6.42:5.6": "There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. Let them enjoy the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity.”",
  "an6.42:6.1": "“Sir, may the Blessed One please relent now! May the Holy One relent!",
