  "an6.54:10.4": "The Buddha said to him:",
  "an6.54:10.5": "“So, Brahmin Dhammika, where have you come from?”",
  "an6.54:10.6": "“Sir, I’ve been banished by the local lay followers from all seven monasteries in my native land.”",
  "an6.54:10.7": "“Enough, Brahmin Dhammika, what’s that to you? Now that you’ve been banished from all of those places, you have come to me.",

  "an6.54:11.5": "But if it saw no land it returned to the ship.",
  "an6.54:11.6": "In the same way, now that you’ve been banished from all of those places, you have come to me.",
  "an6.54:12.1": "Once upon a time, King Koravya had a royal banyan tree with five trunks called “Well Planted”. It was shady and lovely. ",

  "an6.54:13.1": "Then a certain person ate as much as he liked of the fruit, then broke off a branch and left.",

  "an6.54:13.3": "“It’s incredible, it’s amazing!",
  "an6.54:13.4": "How wicked this person is, to eat as much as they like, then break off a branch and leave! Why don’t I make sure that the royal banyan tree gives no fruit in future?”",
  "an6.54:13.5": "Then the royal banyan tree gave no more fruit.",
  "an6.54:14.1": "Then King Koravya went up to Sakka, the Lord of Gods, ",
  "an6.54:14.2": "and said to him:",
  "an6.54:14.3": "‘Please sir, you should know that the royal banyan tree called Well Planted gives no fruit.’",
  "an6.54:14.4": "Then Sakka used his psychic powers to will that a violent storm come. And it felled and uprooted the royal banyan tree.",
  "an6.54:14.5": "Then the god haunting the tree stood to one side, miserable and sad, weeping, with a tearful face.",
  "an6.54:15.1": "Then Sakka went up to that god,",
  "an6.54:15.2": "and said:",
  "an6.54:15.3": "‘Why, god, are you standing to one side, miserable and sad, weeping, with a tearful face?’",
  "an6.54:15.4": "‘Because, my good sir, a violent storm came and felled and uprooted my home.’",
  "an6.54:15.5": "‘Well, did you stand by your tree’s duty when the storm came?’",
  "an6.54:15.6": "‘But how, my good sir, does a tree stand by its duty?’",
  "an6.54:15.7": "‘It’s when those who need the tree’s roots, bark, leaves, flowers or fruit take what they need.",
  "an6.54:15.8": "Yet the god is not displeased or upset or upset because of this.",
  "an6.54:15.9": "This is how a tree stands by its duty.’",
  "an6.54:15.10": "‘I was not standing by a tree’s duty when the storm came and felled and uprooted my home.’",
  "an6.54:15.11": "‘God, if you were to stand by a tree’s duty, your home may be as it was before.’",
  "an6.54:15.12": "‘I will stand by a tree’s duty! May my home be as it was before!’",
  "an6.54:16.1": "Then Sakka used his psychic powers to will that a violent storm come. And it raised up that mighty banyan tree and the bark of the roots was healed.",
  "an6.54:16.2": "In the same way, Brahmin Dhammika, were you doing an ascetic’s duty when the local lay followers banished you from all seven of the monasteries in your native land?”",
  "an6.54:16.3": "“But sir, how do I stand by an ascetic’s duty?”",
  "an6.54:16.4": "“When someone abuses, annoys, or argues with an ascetic, the ascetic doesn’t abuse, annoy, or argue back at them.",
  "an6.54:16.5": "That’s how an ascetic stands by an ascetic’s duty.”",
  "an6.54:16.6": "“I was not standing by an ascetic’s duty when the local lay followers banished me from all seven of the monasteries in my native land.”",
  "an6.54:17.1": "“Once upon a time, there was a Teacher called Sunetta. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire.",
  "an6.54:17.2": "He had many hundreds of disciples.",
  "an6.54:17.3": "He taught them the way to rebirth in the company of Brahmā.",
  "an6.54:17.4": "Those lacking confidence in Sunetta were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.",
  "an6.54:17.5": "Those full of confidence in Sunetta were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.",
  "an6.54:18.1": "Once upon a time there was a teacher called Mūgapakkha …",

  "an6.54:22.5": "Those full of confidence in Jotipāla were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.",
  "an6.54:23.1": "What do you think, Brahmin Dhammika? If someone with malicious intent were to abuse and insult these six teachers with their hundreds of followers, would they not make much bad karma?”",
  "an6.54:23.2": "“Yes, sir.” ",
  "an6.54:23.3": "“They would indeed.",
  "an6.54:23.4": "But someone who abuses and insults a single person accomplished in view with malicious intent makes even more bad karma.",
  "an6.54:23.5": "Why is that? ",
  "an6.54:23.6": "Brahmin Dhammika, I say that outside of the Buddhist community there is no injury like that of harming one’s spiritual companions.",
  "an6.54:23.7": "So you should train like this:",
  "an6.54:23.8": "‘We will have no malicious intent for those who we want to have as our spiritual companions.’",
  "an6.54:23.9": "That is how you should train.”",
