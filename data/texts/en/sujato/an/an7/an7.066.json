  "an7.66:4.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "an7.66:4.6": "The Buddha said this:  ",
  "an7.66:5.1": "“Mendicants, conditions are impermanent.",
  "an7.66:5.2": "Conditions are unstable.",
  "an7.66:5.3": "Conditions are unreliable.",
  "an7.66:5.4": "This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed from all conditions. ",
  "an7.66:6.1": "Sineru, the king of mountains, is 84,000 leagues long and 84,000 leagues wide. It sinks 84,000 leagues below the ocean and rises 84,000 leagues above it.",
  "an7.66:6.2": "There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, the rain doesn’t fall. For many years, many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years no rain falls.",
  "an7.66:6.3": "When this happens, the plants and seeds, the herbs, grass, and big trees wither away and dry up, and are no more.",
  "an7.66:6.4": "So impermanent are conditions,",
  "an7.66:6.5": "so unstable, so unreliable. ",
  "an7.66:6.6": "This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed from all conditions. ",

  "an7.66:7.2": "When this happens, the streams and pools wither away and dry up, and are no more.",

  "an7.66:8.1": "There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a third sun appears.",
  "an7.66:8.2": "When this happens, the great rivers—",
  "an7.66:8.3": "the Ganges, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī—wither away and dry up, and are no more.",
  "an7.66:8.4": "So impermanent are conditions … ",
  "an7.66:9.1": "There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a fourth sun appears.",
  "an7.66:9.2": "When this happens, the great lakes from which the rivers originate—",

  "an7.66:11.1": "There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a sixth sun appears.",
  "an7.66:11.2": "When this happens, this great earth and Sineru the king of mountains smoke and smolder and give off fumes. ",

  "an7.66:12.4": "Sineru the king of mountains blazes and burns, crumbling as it’s overcome by the great heat. And meanwhile, mountain peaks a hundred leagues high, or two, three, four, or five hundred leagues high disintegrate as they burn.",
  "an7.66:12.5": "And when the great earth and Sineru the king of mountains blaze and burn, no soot or ash is found.",
  "an7.66:12.6": "It’s like when ghee or oil blaze and burn, and neither ashes nor soot are found.",
  "an7.66:12.7": "In the same way, when the great earth and Sineru the king of mountains blaze and burn, no soot or ash is found.",
  "an7.66:12.8": "So impermanent are conditions, ",
  "an7.66:12.9": "so unstable are conditions,",
  "an7.66:12.10": "so unreliable are conditions.",
  "an7.66:12.11": "This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed from all conditions. ",
  "an7.66:13.1": "Mendicants, who would ever think or believe that",
  "an7.66:13.2": "this earth and Sineru, king of mountains, will burn and crumble and be no more, except for one who has seen the truth?",
  "an7.66:14.1": "Once upon a time, there was a Teacher called Sunetta. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire.",
  "an7.66:14.2": "He had many hundreds of disciples.",
  "an7.66:14.3": "He taught them the way to rebirth in the company of Brahmā.",
  "an7.66:14.4": "Those who totally understood Sunetta’s teachings were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, the company of Brahmā.",
  "an7.66:14.5": "Of those who didn’t totally understand Sunetta’s teachings, some—when their body broke up, after death—were reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others. Some were reborn in the company of the Gods Who Love to Create, some with the Joyful Gods, some with the Gods of Yama, some with the Gods of the Thirty-three, and some with the Gods of the Four Great Kings. Some were reborn in the company of propertied aristocrats or brahmins or householders.",
  "an7.66:15.1": "Then the Teacher Sunetta thought:",
  "an7.66:15.2": "‘It’s not proper for me to be reborn in the next life in exactly the same place as my disciples. Why don’t I further develop love?’",
  "an7.66:16.1": "Then Sunetta developed love for seven years.",
  "an7.66:16.2": "Having done so he did not return to this world for seven eons of world expansion and contraction.",
  "an7.66:16.3": "As the world contracted he went to the realm of streaming radiance. ",
  "an7.66:16.4": "As it evolved he was reborn in an empty mansion of Brahmā.",
  "an7.66:16.5": "There he was Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the undefeated, the champion, the universal seer, the wielder of power. ",
  "an7.66:16.6": "He was Sakka the Lord of Gods thirty-six times.",
  "an7.66:16.7": "Many hundreds of times he was a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extended to all four sides, he achieved stability in the country, and he possessed the seven treasures.",
  "an7.66:16.8": "He had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of my enemies.",
  "an7.66:16.9": "After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigned by principle, without rod or sword.",
  "an7.66:16.10": "Yet even though Sunetta lived so long and lasted so long, he was not exempt from",
  "an7.66:16.11": "birth, old age, and death. He was not exempt from sorrow, crying, pain, dejection, and despair, I say.",
  "an7.66:17.1": "Why is that? ",
  "an7.66:17.2": "Because of not understanding and not penetrating four things.",
  "an7.66:17.3": "What four? ",
  "an7.66:17.4": "Noble ethics, samādhi, wisdom, and freedom.",
  "an7.66:17.5": "This noble ethics, samādhi, wisdom, and freedom have been understood and penetrated. Craving to be reborn has been cut off; the attachment to being reborn is ended; now there are no more future lives. ",
  "an7.66:17.6": "This is what the Buddha said.  ",
  "an7.66:17.7": "Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: ",
  "an7.66:18.1": "“Ethics, samādhi, and wisdom, ",
  "an7.66:18.2": "and the supreme freedom: ",
  "an7.66:18.3": "these things have been understood ",
  "an7.66:18.4": "by Gotama the renowned. ",
  "an7.66:19.1": "And so the Buddha, having insight, ",
  "an7.66:19.2": "explained this Dharma to the mendicants. ",
  "an7.66:19.3": "The Teacher has made an end of suffering;",
  "an7.66:19.4": "seeing clearly, he is extinguished.” "
