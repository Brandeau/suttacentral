  "mn67:3.4": "And the visiting mendicants, while exchanging greetings with the resident mendicants, preparing their lodgings, and putting away their bowls and robes, made a dreadful racket.",
  "mn67:3.5": "Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda:",
  "mn67:3.6": "“Ānanda, who’s making that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”",
