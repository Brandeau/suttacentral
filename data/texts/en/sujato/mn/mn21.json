  "mn21:3.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn21:3.3": "Now at that time, Venerable Phagguna of the Top-Knot was mixing overly closely together with the nuns.",
  "mn21:3.4": "So much so that",
  "mn21:3.5": "if any mendicant criticized those nuns in his presence, Phagguna of the Top-Knot got angry and upset, and even instigated disciplinary proceedings.",
  "mn21:3.6": "if any mendicant criticized those nuns in his presence, Phagguna of the Top-Knot got angry and upset, and even instigated disciplinary proceedings.",
  "mn21:3.7": "That’s how much Phagguna of the Top-Knot was mixing overly closely together with the nuns.",
  "mn21:4.1": "Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha,",
  "mn21:4.2": "bowed, sat down to one side, ",
  "mn21:4.3": "and told him what was going on.",
  "mn21:5.1": "So the Buddha said to a certain monk:",
  "mn21:5.2": "“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Phagguna of the Top-Knot that",
  "mn21:5.3": "the teacher calls him.”",
  "mn21:5.4": "“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Phagguna of the Top-Knot",
  "mn21:5.5": "and said to him:",
  "mn21:5.6": "“Reverend Phagguna, the teacher calls you.”",
  "mn21:5.7": "“Yes, reverend,” Phagguna replied. He went to the Buddha,",
  "mn21:5.8": "bowed, and sat down to one side.",
  "mn21:5.9": "The Buddha said to him:",
  "mn21:6.1": "“It is really true, Phagguna, that you’ve been mixing overly closely together with the nuns.",
  "mn21:6.2": "So much so that",
  "mn21:6.3": "if any mendicant criticizes those nuns in his presence, you get angry and upset, and even instigate disciplinary proceedings.",
  "mn21:6.4": "And if any mendicant criticizes you in those nuns’ presence, they get angry and upset, and even instigate disciplinary proceedings.",
  "mn21:6.5": "Is that how much you’re mixing overly closely together with the nuns?”",
  "mn21:6.6": "“Yes, sir.” ",
  "mn21:6.7": "“Phagguna, are you not a member of a respectable family who has gone forth from the lay life into homelessness?”",
  "mn21:6.8": "“Yes, sir.”",
  "mn21:7.1": "“As such, it’s not appropriate for you mix so closely with the nuns.",
  "mn21:7.2": "So if anyone criticizes those nuns in your presence, you should give up any desires or thoughts of the lay life.",
  "mn21:7.3": "If that happens, you should train like this:",
  "mn21:7.4": "‘Our minds will remain unaffected. We will blurt out no bad words. We will remain full of compassion, with a heart of love and no secret hate.",
  "mn21:7.5": "That’s how you should train.",
  "mn21:8.1": "So even if someone strikes those nuns with fists, stones, rods, and swords in your presence,",
  "mn21:8.2": "you should give up any desires or thoughts of the lay life.",
  "mn21:8.3": "If that happens, you should train like this: ‘My mind will be unaffected. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of compassion, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’",
  "mn21:8.4": "That’s how you should train.",
  "mn21:9.1": "So if anyone criticizes you in your presence, you should give up any desires or thoughts of the lay life.",
  "mn21:9.2": "If that happens, you should train yourself: ‘My mind will be unaffected. I will blurt out no bad words. I will live full of compassion, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’",
  "mn21:9.3": "That’s how you should train.",
  "mn21:10.1": "So Phagguṇa, even if someone strikes you with fists, stones, rods, and swords, you should give up any desires or thoughts of the lay life.",
  "mn21:10.2": "If that happens, you should train yourself: ‘My mind will be unaffected. I will blurt out no bad words. I will live full of compassion, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’",
  "mn21:10.3": "That’s how you should train.”",
  "mn21:11.1": "Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:",
  "mn21:11.2": "“Mendicants, I used to be satisfied with the mendicants.",
  "mn21:11.3": "Once, I addressed them:",
  "mn21:11.4": "‘I eat my food in one sitting per day.",
  "mn21:11.5": "Doing so, I find that I’m healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.",
  "mn21:11.6": "You too should eat your food in one sitting per day.",
  "mn21:11.7": "Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.’",
  "mn21:11.8": "I didn’t have to keep on instructing those mendicants;",
  "mn21:11.9": "I just had to prompt their mindfulness.",
  "mn21:12.1": "Suppose a chariot stood harnessed to thoroughbreds at a level crossroads, with a goad ready. ",
  "mn21:12.2": "Then a skilled horse trainer, a master charioteer, might mount the chariot, taking the reins in his right hand and goad in the left. He’d drive out and back wherever he wishes, whenever he wishes.",
  "mn21:12.3": "In the same way, I didn’t have to keep on instructing those mendicants; I just had to prompt their mindfulness.",
  "mn21:12.4": "So, mendicants, give up what’s unskillful and devote yourselves to skillful qualities.",
  "mn21:12.5": "In this way you’ll achieve growth, improvement, and maturity in this teaching and training.",
  "mn21:13.1": "Suppose that not far from a town or village there was a large grove of sal trees",
  "mn21:13.2": "that was choked with castor-oil weeds.",
  "mn21:13.3": "Then along comes a person who wants to help protect and nurture that grove.",
  "mn21:13.4": "They’d cut down the crooked sal saplings that were robbing the sap, and throw them out. They’d clean up the interior of the grove,",
  "mn21:13.5": "and properly care for the straight, well-formed sal saplings.",
  "mn21:13.6": "In this way, in due course, that sal grove would grow, increase, and mature.",
  "mn21:13.7": "In the same way, mendicants, give up what’s unskillful and devote yourselves to skillful qualities.",
  "mn21:13.8": "In this way you’ll achieve growth, improvement, and maturity in this teaching and training.",
  "mn21:14.1": "Once upon a time, mendicants, right here in Sāvatthī there was a housewife named Vedehikā.",
  "mn21:14.2": "She had this good reputation:",
  "mn21:14.3": "‘The housewife Vedehikā is sweet, even-tempered, and calm.’",
  "mn21:14.4": "Now, Vedehikā had a maid-servant named Kāḷī who was skilled and tireless and well-organized in her work.",
  "mn21:15.1": "Then she thought:",
  "mn21:15.2": "‘My mistress has a good reputation as being",
  "mn21:15.3": "sweet, even-tempered, and calm.",
  "mn21:15.4": "But does she actually have anger in her and just not show it? Or does she have no anger? Or is it just because my work is well-organized that she doesn’t show anger, even though she still has it inside?",
  "mn21:15.5": "Why don’t I test my mistress?’",
  "mn21:15.6": "So Kāḷī got up during the day.",
  "mn21:15.7": "Vedehikā said to her:",
  "mn21:15.8": "‘Hey, Kāḷī!’",
  "mn21:15.9": "‘What is it, madam?’",
  "mn21:15.10": "‘You’re getting up in the day—what’s up with you?’",
  "mn21:15.11": "‘Nothing, madam.’",
  "mn21:15.12": "‘Nothing’s up, you bad girl, but you get up in the day!’ Angry and upset, she scowled.",
  "mn21:15.13": "Then Kāḷī thought:",
  "mn21:15.14": "‘My mistress actually has anger in her and just doesn’t show it; it’s not that she has no anger. ",
  "mn21:15.15": "It’s just because my work is well-organized that she doesn’t show anger, even though she still has it inside.",
  "mn21:15.16": "Why don’t I test my mistress further?’",
  "mn21:16.1": "So Kāḷī got up later in the day.",
  "mn21:16.2": "Vedehikā said to her:",
  "mn21:16.3": "‘Hey, Kāḷī!’",
  "mn21:16.4": "‘What is it, madam?’",
  "mn21:16.5": "‘You’re getting up later in the day—what’s up with you?’",
  "mn21:16.6": "‘Nothing, madam.’",
  "mn21:16.7": "‘Nothing’s up, you bad girl, but you get up later in the day!’ Angry and upset, she blurted out angry words.",
  "mn21:16.8": "Then Kāḷī thought:",
  "mn21:16.9": "‘My mistress actually has anger in her and just doesn’t show it; it’s not that she has no anger.",
  "mn21:16.10": "It’s just because my work is well-organized that she doesn’t show anger, even though she still has it inside.",
  "mn21:16.11": "Why don’t I test my mistress further?’",
  "mn21:17.1": "So Kāḷī got up even later in the day.",
  "mn21:17.2": "Vedehikā said to her:",
  "mn21:17.3": "‘Hey, Kāḷī!’",
  "mn21:17.4": "‘What is it, madam?’",
  "mn21:17.5": "‘You’re getting up even later in the day—what’s up with you?’",
  "mn21:17.6": "‘Nothing, madam.’",
  "mn21:17.7": "‘Nothing’s up, you bad girl, but you get up even later in the day!’ Angry and upset, she grabbed a rolling-pin and hit Kāḷī on the head, cracking it open.",
  "mn21:17.8": "Then Kāḷī, with blood pouring from her cracked skull, denounced her mistress to the neighbors:",
  "mn21:17.9": "‘See, ladies, what the sweet one did!",
  "mn21:17.10": "See what the even-tempered one did! See what the calm one did!",
  "mn21:17.11": "How on earth can she grab a rolling-pin and hit her only maid on the head, cracking it open, just for getting up late?’",
  "mn21:18.1": "Then after some time the housewife Vedehikā got this bad reputation:",
  "mn21:18.2": "‘The housewife Vedehikā is fierce, ill-tempered, and not calm at all.’",
  "mn21:19.1": "In the same way, a mendicant may be the sweetest of the sweet, the most even-tempered of the even-tempered, the calmest of the calm, so long as they don’t encounter any disagreeable criticism.",
  "mn21:19.2": "But it’s when they encounter disagreeable criticism that you’ll know whether they’re really sweet, even-tempered, and calm.",
  "mn21:19.3": "I don’t say that a mendicant is easy to admonish if they make themselves easy to admonish only for the sake of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.",
  "mn21:19.4": "Why is that?",
  "mn21:19.5": "Because when they don’t get robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick, they’re no longer easy to admonish.",
  "mn21:19.6": "But when a mendicant is easy to admonish purely because they honor, respect, reverence, and worship the teaching, then I say that they’re easy to admonish.",
  "mn21:19.7": "So, mendicants, you should train yourselves: ‘We will be easy to admonish purely because we honor, respect, revere, and worship the teaching.’",
  "mn21:19.8": "That’s how you should train.",
  "mn21:20.1": "Mendicants, there are these five ways in which others might criticize you.",
  "mn21:20.2": "Their speech may be timely or untimely,",
  "mn21:20.3": "true or false,",
  "mn21:20.4": "gentle or harsh,",
  "mn21:20.5": "beneficial or harmful,",
  "mn21:20.6": "from a heart of love or from secret hate.",
  "mn21:20.7": "When others criticize you, they may do so in any of these ways.",
  "mn21:20.12": "If that happens, you should train like this:",
  "mn21:20.13": "‘Our minds will remain unaffected. We will blurt out no bad words. We will remain full of compassion, with a heart of love and no secret hate.",
  "mn21:20.14": "We will meditate spreading a heart of love to that person. And with them as a basis, we will meditate spreading a heart full of love to everyone in the world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.’",
  "mn21:20.15": "That’s how you should train.",
  "mn21:21.1": "Suppose a person was to come along carrying a spade and basket",
  "mn21:21.2": "and say:",
  "mn21:21.3": "‘I shall make this great earth be without earth!’",
  "mn21:21.4": "And they’d dig all over, scatter all over, spit all over, and urinate all over, saying:",
  "mn21:21.5": "‘Be without earth! Be without earth!’",
  "mn21:21.6": "What do you think, mendicants? Could that person make this great earth be without earth?”",
  "mn21:21.7": "“No, sir.",
  "mn21:21.8": "Why is that?",
  "mn21:21.9": "Because this great earth is deep and limitless.",
  "mn21:21.10": "It’s not easy to make it be without earth.",
  "mn21:21.11": "That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”",
  "mn21:21.12": "In the same way, there are these five ways in which others might criticize you.",
  "mn21:21.13": "Their speech may be timely or untimely,",

  "mn21:21.25": "We will meditate spreading a heart of love to that person. And with them as a basis, we will meditate spreading a heart full of love to everyone in the world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.’",
  "mn21:21.26": "That’s how you should train.",
  "mn21:22.1": "Suppose a person was to come along with dye such as red lac, turmeric, indigo, or rose madder",
  "mn21:22.2": "and say:",
  "mn21:22.3": "‘I shall draw pictures on the sky, making pictures appear there.’",
  "mn21:22.4": "What do you think, mendicants? Could that person draw pictures on the sky?”",
  "mn21:22.5": "“No, sir.",
  "mn21:22.6": "Why is that? ",
  "mn21:22.7": "Because the sky is formless and invisible.",
  "mn21:22.8": "It’s not easy to draw pictures there.",
  "mn21:22.9": "That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”",
  "mn21:22.10": "“In the same way, there are these five ways in which others might criticize you …",
