  "mn22:3.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.",
  "mn22:3.3": "Now at that time a mendicant called Ariṭtha, who had previously been a vulture trapper, had the following harmful misconception:",
  "mn22:3.4": "“As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.”",
  "mn22:3.5": "Several mendicants heard about this.",
  "mn22:4.1": "They went up to Ariṭṭha",
  "mn22:4.2": "and said to him:",
  "mn22:4.3": "“Is it really true, Reverend Ariṭṭha, that you have such a harmful misconception: ",
  "mn22:4.4": "‘As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them’?”",
  "mn22:4.5": "“Absolutely, reverends. As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.”",
  "mn22:5.1": "Then, wishing to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the mendicants engaged, pressed, and kept talking with him:",
  "mn22:5.2": "“Don’t say that, Ariṭṭha! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.",
  "mn22:5.4": "In many ways the Buddha has said that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them. ",
  "mn22:5.5": "The Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.",
  "mn22:5.6": "With the similes of a skeleton …",
  "mn22:5.7": "a lump of meat …",

  "mn22:6.1": "But even though the mendicants engaged, pressed, and kept talking with him in this way, Ariṭṭha obstinately held on to his misconception and insisted on stating it.",
  "mn22:7.1": "When they weren’t able to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the mendicants went to the Buddha,",
  "mn22:7.2": "bowed, sat down to one side, ",
  "mn22:7.3": "and told him what had happened.",
  "mn22:11.1": "So the Buddha said to a certain monk:",
  "mn22:11.2": "“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture trapper, that",
  "mn22:11.3": "the teacher calls him.”",
  "mn22:11.4": "“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Ariṭṭha",
  "mn22:11.5": "and said to him:",
  "mn22:11.6": "“Reverend Ariṭṭha, the teacher calls you.”",
  "mn22:11.7": "“Yes, reverend,” Ariṭṭha replied. He went to the Buddha,",
  "mn22:11.8": "bowed, and sat down to one side.",
  "mn22:11.9": "The Buddha said to him:",

  "mn22:11.13": " ",
  "mn22:12.1": "“Foolish man, who on earth have you ever known me to teach in that way?",

  "mn22:12.16": "This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.”",
  "mn22:13.1": "Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:",
  "mn22:13.2": "“What do you think, mendicants? Has this mendicant Ariṭṭha even begun to warm up in this teaching and training?”",
  "mn22:13.3": "“How could that be, sir?",
  "mn22:13.4": "No, sir.” ",
  "mn22:13.5": "When this was said, Ariṭṭha sat silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.",
  "mn22:13.6": "Knowing this, the Buddha said:",
  "mn22:13.7": "“Foolish man, you will be known by your own harmful misconception.",
  "mn22:13.8": "I’ll question the mendicants about this.”",
  "mn22:14.1": "Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: ",
  "mn22:14.2": "“Mendicants, do you understand my teachings as Ariṭṭha does, when he misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and makes much bad karma?”",
  "mn22:14.3": "“No, sir.",
  "mn22:14.4": "For in many ways the Buddha has said that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them. ",
  "mn22:14.6": "The Buddha has said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.",

  "mn22:15.1": "“Good, good, mendicants! It’s good that you understand my teaching like this.",

  "mn22:16.4": "I’ve said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.",
  "mn22:16.5": "But still this Ariṭṭha misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and makes much bad karma.",
  "mn22:16.6": "This will be for his lasting harm and suffering.",
  "mn22:16.7": "Truly, mendicants, it’s not possible to perform sensual acts without sensual pleasures, sensual perceptions, and sensual thoughts.",
  "mn22:17.1": "Take a foolish person who memorizes the teaching—",

  "mn22:18.2": "they’d see a big snake,",
  "mn22:18.3": "and grasp it by the coil or the tail.",
  "mn22:18.4": "But that snake would twist back and bite them on the hand or the arm or limb,",

  "mn22:20.18": "But if I’ve said anything that you don’t understand, you should ask me about it, or some competent mendicants.",
  "mn22:21.1": "Mendicants, I will teach you how the Dhamma is similar to a raft: it’s for crossing over, not for holding on.",
  "mn22:21.2": "Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”",
  "mn22:21.3": "“Yes, sir,” they replied.",

  "mn22:22.8": "And so they’d do exactly that.",
  "mn22:22.9": "And when they’d crossed over to the far shore, they’d think:",

  "mn22:22.11": "Riding on the raft, and paddling with my hands and feet, I have safely crossed over to the far shore.",
  "mn22:22.12": "Why don’t I hoist it on my head or pick it up on my shoulder and go wherever I want?’",
  "mn22:22.13": "What do you think, mendicants? Would that person be doing what should be done with that raft?”",
  "mn22:23.1": "“No, sir.”",

  "mn22:23.8": "In the same way, I have taught how the teaching is similar to a raft: it’s for crossing over, not for holding on.",
  "mn22:23.9": "By understanding the simile of the raft, you will even give up the teachings, let alone what is against the teachings.",
  "mn22:24.1": "Mendicants, there are these six grounds for views.",

  "mn22:24.3": "Take an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in their teaching. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in their teaching. They regard form like this: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’",
