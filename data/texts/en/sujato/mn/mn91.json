  "mn91:3.3": "Now at that time the brahmin Brahmāyu was residing in Mithilā. He was old, elderly, and senior, having lived long and reached the final stage of life; he was a hundred and twenty years old. He was an expert in the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philology and grammar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.",
  "mn91:3.4": "He heard:",
  "mn91:3.5": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is wandering in the land of the Videhans, together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.",
  "mn91:3.6": "He has this good reputation: ",
  "mn91:3.7": "‘That Blessed One is perfect, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme trainer of people, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’",
  "mn91:3.8": "He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.",
  "mn91:3.9": "He explains a teaching that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.",
  "mn91:3.10": "It’s good to see such perfected ones.”",
  "mn91:4.1": "Now at that time the brahmin Brahmāyu had a student named Uttara. He too was an expert in the three Vedas, etc.",
  "mn91:4.2": "Then Brahmāyu told Uttara of this, and added:",
  "mn91:4.8": "Please, dear Uttara, go to the ascetic Gotama",
  "mn91:4.9": "and find out whether or not the ascetic Gotama lives up to his reputation.",
  "mn91:4.11": "Through you I shall learn about Mister Gotama.”",
  "mn91:4.12": "“But how, sir, shall I find out whether or not the ascetic Gotama lives up to his reputation?”",
  "mn91:4.14": "“Dear Uttara, the thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.",
  "mn91:4.15": "If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures.",
  "mn91:4.16": "He has the following seven treasures:",
  "mn91:4.17": "the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the adviser as the seventh treasure.",

  "mn91:4.22": "and you are the one who receives them.”",
  "mn91:5.1": "“Yes, sir,” replied Uttara. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Brahmāyu before setting out for the land of the Videhans where the Buddha was wandering.",
  "mn91:5.2": "Travelling stage by stage, he came to the Buddha",
  "mn91:5.3": "and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "mn91:5.4": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,",
  "mn91:5.5": "and searched his body for the thirty-two marks of a great man.",
  "mn91:5.6": "He saw all of them except for two,",
  "mn91:5.7": "which he had doubts about:",
  "mn91:5.8": "whether the private parts are retracted, and the largeness of the tongue.",
  "mn91:5.9": "Then it occurred to the Buddha:",

  "mn91:5.11": "which he has doubts about:",
  "mn91:5.12": "whether the private parts are retracted, and the largeness of the tongue.”",
  "mn91:5.13": "Then the Buddha used his psychic powers to will that Uttara would see his retracted private parts.",
