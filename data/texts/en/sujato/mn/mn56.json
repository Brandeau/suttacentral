  "mn56:3.3": "At that time Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta was residing at Nāḷandā together with a large assembly of Jain ascetics.",
  "mn56:3.4": "Then the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī wandered for alms in Nāḷandā. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to Pāvārika’s mango grove. There he approached the Buddha,",
  "mn56:3.5": "and exchanged greetings with him.",
  "mn56:3.6": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side.",
  "mn56:3.7": "The Buddha said to him:",
  "mn56:3.8": "“There are seats, Tapassī.",
  "mn56:3.9": "Please sit if you wish.”",
  "mn56:3.10": "When he said this, Dīgha Tapassī took a low seat and sat to one side.",
  "mn56:3.11": "The Buddha said to him:",
  "mn56:3.12": "“Tapassī, how many kinds of deed does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describe for performing bad deeds?”",
  "mn56:4.1": "“Reverend Gotama, Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta doesn’t usually speak in terms of ‘deeds’.",
  "mn56:4.2": "He usually speaks in terms of ‘rods’.",
  "mn56:5.1": "“Then how many kinds of rod does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describe for performing bad deeds?”",
  "mn56:6.1": "“Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describes three kinds of rod for performing bad deeds:",
  "mn56:6.2": "the physical rod, the verbal rod, and the mental rod.”",
  "mn56:7.1": "“But are these kinds of rod all distinct from each other?”",
  "mn56:8.1": "“Yes, each is quite distinct.”",
  "mn56:9.1": "“Of the three rods thus analyzed and differentiated, which rod does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describe as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds: the physical rod, the verbal rod, or the mental rod?”",
  "mn56:10.1": "“Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describes the physical rod as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.”",
  "mn56:11.1": "“Do you say the physical rod, Tapassī?”",
  "mn56:12.1": "“I say the physical rod, Reverend Gotama.”",
  "mn56:13.1": "“Do you say the physical rod, Tapassī?”",
  "mn56:14.1": "“I say the physical rod, Reverend Gotama.”",

  "mn56:16.1": "“I say the physical rod, Reverend Gotama.”",
  "mn56:17.1": "Thus the Buddha made Dīgha Tapassī stand by this point up to the third time.",

  "mn56:33.2": "Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta saw Dīgha Tapassī coming off in the distance",
  "mn56:33.3": "and said to him:",
  "mn56:33.4": "“So, Tapassī, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”",
  "mn56:33.5": "“Just now, sir, I’ve come from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.”",
  "mn56:33.6": "“But did you have some discussion with him?”",
  "mn56:33.7": "“I did.”",
  "mn56:33.8": "“But what kind of discussion did you have with him?”",
  "mn56:33.9": "Then Dīgha Tapassī informed Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta of all they had discussed.",
  "mn56:33.10": "When he had spoken, Nigaṇṭha said to him:",
  "mn56:33.11": "“Good, good Tapassī!",
  "mn56:33.12": "Dīgha Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like an educated disciple who rightly understands their teacher’s instructions.",
  "mn56:33.13": "For how impressive is the measly mental rod when compared with the substantial physical rod?",
  "mn56:33.14": "Rather, the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.”",
  "mn56:34.1": "When he said this, the householder Upāli said to him:",

  "mn56:34.7": "If he stands by the position that he stated to Dīgha Tapassī,",
  "mn56:34.8": "I’ll take him on in debate and drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong man would drag a fleecy sheep to and fro and round about!",
  "mn56:34.10": "Taking him on in debate, I’ll drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong brewer’s worker would toss a large brewer’s sieve into a deep lake, grab it by the corners, and drag it to and fro and round about!",
  "mn56:34.12": "Taking him on in debate, I’ll shake him down and about and give him a beating, like a strong brewer’s mixer would grab a strainer by the corners and shake it down and about, and give it a beating!",
  "mn56:34.14": "I’ll play a game of ear-washing with the ascetic Gotama, like a sixty year old elephant would plunge into a deep lotus pond and play a game of ear-washing!",
  "mn56:34.16": "Sir, I’d better go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine on this point.”",
  "mn56:34.17": "“Go, householder, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine on this point.",
  "mn56:34.18": "For either I should do so, or Dīgha Tapassī, or you.”",
  "mn56:35.1": "When he said this, Dīgha Tapassī said to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta:",
  "mn56:35.2": "“Sir, I don’t think it’s a good idea for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.",

  "mn56:35.4": "“It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotama’s disciple.",

  "mn56:35.17": "“Yes, sir,” replied Upāli son. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Buddha,",
  "mn56:35.18": "bowed, sat down to one side, ",
  "mn56:35.19": "and said to him:",
  "mn56:35.20": "“Sir, did the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī come here?”",
  "mn56:36.1": "“He did, householder.”",
  "mn56:37.1": "“But did you have some discussion with him?”",
  "mn56:38.1": "“I did.”",
  "mn56:39.1": "“But what kind of discussion did you have with him?”",

  "mn56:42.1": "“What do you think, householder? Take a Jain ascetic who is sick, suffering, gravely ill. They reject cold water and use only hot water.",
  "mn56:42.2": "Not getting cold water, they might die.",
  "mn56:42.3": "Now, where does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta say they would be reborn?”",
  "mn56:43.1": "“Sir, there are gods called ‘mind-bound’. They would be reborn there.",
  "mn56:44.1": "Why is that?",
  "mn56:45.1": "Because they died with mental attachment.”",
  "mn56:46.1": "“Think about it, householder! You should think before answering.",
  "mn56:46.2": "What you said before and what you said after don’t match up.",

  "mn56:47.1": "“What do you think, householder? Take a Jain ascetic who may be restrained in the fourfold restraint: obstructed by all water, devoted to all water, shaking off all water, pervaded by all water.",
  "mn56:47.2": "When going out and coming back they accidentally injure many little creatures.",
  "mn56:47.3": "Now, what result does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta say they would incur?”",

  "mn56:67.1": "“Sir, I was already delighted and satisfied by the Buddha’s very first simile.",
  "mn56:67.2": "Nevertheless, I wanted to hear the Buddha’s various solutions to the problem, so I thought I’d oppose you in this way.",
  "mn56:67.3": "Excellent, sir! Excellent!",
  "mn56:67.4": "As if he was righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark ",
  "mn56:67.5": "so people with good eyes can see what’s there, ",

  "mn56:68.5": "‘The householder Upāli has become our disciple!’",
  "mn56:68.6": "And yet the Buddha says:",

  "mn56:69.12": "From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” ",
  "mn56:70.1": "Then the Buddha taught Sīha step by step, with",
  "mn56:70.2": "talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.",
  "mn56:70.3": "And when he knew that Upāli’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, joyful, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: ",

  "mn56:70.7": "“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”",
  "mn56:70.8": "Then Upāli saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha:",
  "mn56:70.9": "“Well, now, sir, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.”",
  "mn56:70.10": "“Please, householder, go when you’re ready.” ",
  "mn56:71.1": "And then the householder Upāli approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went back to his own home,",

  "mn56:71.8": "If you require alms-food, wait here, they will bring it to you.’”",
  "mn56:71.9": "“Yes, sir,” replied the gatekeeper.",
  "mn56:72.1": "Dīgha Tapassī heard that",
  "mn56:72.2": "Upāli had become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama.",

  "mn56:72.15": "“Go, Tapassī, and find out whether or not Upāli has become Gotama’s disciple.”",
  "mn56:73.1": "Then Dīgha Tapassī went to Upāli’s home.",

  "mn56:73.10": "“Sir, it’s really true that Upāli has become Gotama’s disciple.",
  "mn56:73.11": "Sir, I couldn’t get you to accept that it wasn’t a good idea for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.",
  "mn56:73.12": "For the ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of those who follow other paths.",

  "mn56:74.16": "Upāli said to him: “Well, then, my good gatekeeper, prepare seats in the hall of the middle gate.”",
  "mn56:74.17": "“Yes, sir,” replied the gatekeeper. He did as he was asked, then returned to Upāli and said:",

  "mn56:76.16": "For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.",
  "mn56:77.1": "Once upon a time there was an old brahmin, elderly and senior. His wife was a young brahmin lady who was pregnant and approaching the time for giving birth.",
  "mn56:77.2": "Then she said to the brahmin:",
  "mn56:77.3": "‘Go, brahmin, buy a baby monkey from the market and bring it back so it can be a playmate for my child.’",
  "mn56:77.4": "When she said this, the brahmin said to her:",

  "mn56:78.2": "‘I’ve bought this male baby monkey for you so it can be a playmate for your child.’",
  "mn56:78.3": "When he said this, she said to him:",

  "mn56:79.5": "‘Sir, this monkey can withstand a dying, but not a pounding or a pressing.’",
  "mn56:79.6": "In the same way, the doctrine of the foolish Jains looks fine initially—for fools, not for the astute—but can’t withstand being scrutinized or pressed.",
