  "mn102:3.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.",
  "mn102:3.3": "There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: ",
  "mn102:3.4": "“Mendicants!”",
  "mn102:3.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn102:3.6": "The Buddha said this:",
  "mn102:3.7": "“Mendicants, there are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the future, and propose various hypotheses concerning the future.",
  "mn102:3.8": "Some propose this: ‘The self is percipient and is sound after death.’",
  "mn102:3.10": "Some propose this: ‘The self is non-percipient and is sound after death.’",
  "mn102:3.12": "Some propose this: ‘The self is neither percipient nor non-percipient and is sound after death.’",
  "mn102:3.14": "But some advocate the annihilation, eradication, and extermination of an existing being, while others propose extinguishment in the present life.",
  "mn102:3.15": "Thus they advocate an existent self that is sound after death; or they advocate the annihilation of an existing being; or they propose extinguishment in the present life.",
  "mn102:3.16": "In this way five become three, and three become five.",
  "mn102:3.17": "This is the summary of the five and three.",
  "mn102:4.1": "Now, the ascetics and brahmins who advocate a self that is percipient and sound after death describe it as having form, or formless, or both having form and formless, or neither having form nor formless. Or they describe it as of unified perception, or of diverse perception, or of limited perception, or of limitless perception. Or some among those who go beyond this propose universal consciousness, limitless and motionless.",
  "mn102:4.2": "The Realized One understands this:",
  "mn102:4.3": "‘There are ascetics and brahmins who advocate a self that is percipient and sound after death, describing it as having form, or formless, or both having form and formless, or neither having form nor formless. Or they describe it as of unified perception, or of diverse perception, or of limited perception, or of limitless perception.",
  "mn102:4.5": "Or some, aware that “there is nothing at all,” propose the dimension of nothingness, limitless and motionless. They declare that this is the purest, highest, best, and supreme of all those perceptions, whether of form or of formlessness or of unity or of diversity.",
  "mn102:4.6": "All that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions; there is that.’",
  "mn102:4.7": "Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.",
  "mn102:5.1": "Now, the ascetics and brahmins who advocate a self that is non-percipient and sound after death describe it as having form, or formless, or both having form and formless, or neither having form nor formless.",
  "mn102:5.2": "So they reject those who advocate a self that is percipient and sound after death.",
  "mn102:5.3": "Why is that? ",
  "mn102:5.4": "Because they believe that perception is a disease, a boil, a dart, and that the state of non-perception is peaceful and sublime.",
  "mn102:5.6": "The Realized One understands this: ‘There are ascetics and brahmins who advocate a self that is non-percipient and sound after death, describing it as having form, or formless, or both having form and formless, or neither having form nor formless.",
  "mn102:5.7": "But if any ascetic or brahmin should say this:",
  "mn102:5.8": "“Apart from form, feeling, perception, and choices, I will describe the coming and going of consciousness, its passing away and reappearing, its growth, increase, and maturity.” ",
  "mn102:5.9": "That is not possible.",
  "mn102:5.10": "All that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions; there is that.’",
  "mn102:5.11": "Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.",
  "mn102:6.1": "Now, the ascetics and brahmins who advocate a self that is neither percipient nor non-percipient and sound after death describe it as having form, or formless, or both having form and formless, or neither having form nor formless.",
  "mn102:6.2": "So they reject those who advocate a self that is percipient and sound after death, as well as those who advocate a self that is non-percipient and sound after death.",
  "mn102:6.3": "Why is that? ",
  "mn102:6.4": "Because they believe that perception is a disease, a boil, a dart, and that the state of neither perception nor non-perception is peaceful and sublime.",

  "mn102:6.8": "Some ascetics or brahmins advocate the attainment of that dimension merely through the conditioned phenomena of what is seen, heard, thought, and known. But that is said to be a disastrous approach.",
  "mn102:6.9": "For that dimension is said to be not attainable by means of conditioned phenomena,",
  "mn102:6.10": "but only with a residue of conditioned phenomena.",
  "mn102:6.11": "All that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions; there is that.’",
  "mn102:6.12": "Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.",
  "mn102:7.1": "Now, the ascetics and brahmins who advocate the annihilation, eradication, and extermination of an existing being reject those who advocate a self that is sound after death, whether percipient or non-percipient or neither percipient non-percipient.",
  "mn102:7.2": "Why is that? ",
  "mn102:7.3": "Because all of those ascetics and brahmins only assert their attachment to moving up to a higher realm:",
  "mn102:7.4": "‘After death we shall be like this! After death we shall be like that!’",
  "mn102:7.5": "Suppose a trader was going to market, thinking:",
  "mn102:7.6": "‘With this, that shall be mine! This way, I shall get that!’",
  "mn102:7.7": "In the same way, those ascetics and brahmins seem to be like traders when they say:",
  "mn102:7.8": "‘After death we shall be like this! After death we shall be like that!’",
  "mn102:7.9": "The Realized One understands this:",
  "mn102:7.10": "The ascetics and brahmins who advocate the annihilation, eradication, and extermination of an existing being: from fear and disgust with identity, they just keep running and circling around identity.",
  "mn102:7.11": "Suppose a dog on a leash was tethered to a strong post or pillar. It’d just keeping running and circling around that post or pillar.",
  "mn102:7.12": "In the same way, those ascetics and brahmins, from fear and disgust with identity, just keep running and circling around identity.",
  "mn102:7.13": "All that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions; there is that.’",
  "mn102:7.14": "Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.",
  "mn102:8.1": "Whatever ascetics and brahmins theorize about the future, and propose various hypotheses concerning the future, all of them propose one or other of these five theses.",
  "mn102:9.1": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past, and propose various hypotheses concerning the past. They propose the following, each insisting that theirs is the only truth and that everything else is wrong.",
  "mn102:9.2": "‘The self and the world are eternal.’",
  "mn102:9.3": "‘The self and the world are not eternal.’",
