  "mn38:3.1": "<span class=”evam”>So I have heard.</span>",
  "mn38:3.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.",
  "mn38:3.3": "Now at that time a mendicant called Sāti, the fisherman’s son, had the following harmful misconception:",
  "mn38:3.4": "“As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”",
  "mn38:3.5": "Several mendicants heard about this.",
  "mn38:3.8": "They went up to Sāti",
  "mn38:3.9": "and said to him:",
  "mn38:3.10": "“Is it really true, Reverend Sāti, that you have such a harmful misconception: ",
  "mn38:3.11": "‘As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another’?”",
  "mn38:3.12": "“Absolutely, reverends. As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”",
  "mn38:3.13": "Then, wishing to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the mendicants engaged, pressed, and kept talking with him:",
  "mn38:3.14": "“Don’t say that, Sāti! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.",
  "mn38:3.15": "In many ways the Buddha has said that consciousness is dependently originated, since consciousness does not arise without a cause.”",
  "mn38:3.16": "But even though the mendicants pressed him in this way, Sāti obstinately held on to his misconception and insisted on stating it.",
  "mn38:4.1": "When they weren’t able to dissuade Sāti from his view, the mendicants went to the Buddha,",
  "mn38:4.2": "bowed, sat down to one side,",
  "mn38:4.3": "and told him what had happened.",
  "mn38:5.1": "So the Buddha said to a certain monk:",
  "mn38:5.2": "“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Sāti that",
  "mn38:5.3": "the teacher calls him.”",
  "mn38:5.4": "“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Sāti",
  "mn38:5.5": "and said to him:",
  "mn38:5.6": "“Reverend Sāti, the teacher calls you.”",
  "mn38:5.7": "“Yes, reverend,” Sāti replied. He went to the Buddha,",
  "mn38:5.8": "bowed, and sat down to one side.",
  "mn38:5.9": "The Buddha said to him:",
  "mn38:5.10": "“Is it really true, Sāti, that you have such a harmful misconception: ",
  "mn38:5.11": "‘As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another’?”",
  "mn38:5.12": "“Absolutely, sir. As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”",
  "mn38:5.13": "“Sāti, what is that consciousness?”",
  "mn38:5.14": "“Sir, it is he who speaks and feels and experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms.”",
  "mn38:5.15": "“Foolish man, who on earth have you ever known me to teach in that way?",
  "mn38:5.16": "Haven’t I said in many ways that consciousness is dependently originated, since consciousness does not arise without a cause?",
  "mn38:5.17": "But still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp, harm yourself, and make much bad karma.",
  "mn38:5.18": "This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.”",
  "mn38:6.1": "Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:",
  "mn38:6.2": "“What do you think, mendicants? Has this mendicant Sāti even begun to warm up in this teaching and training?”",
  "mn38:6.3": "“How could that be, sir?",
  "mn38:6.4": "No, sir.”",
  "mn38:6.5": "When this was said, Sāti sat silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.",
  "mn38:6.6": "Knowing this, the Buddha said:",
  "mn38:6.7": "“Foolish man, you will be known by your own harmful misconception.",
  "mn38:6.8": "I’ll question the mendicants about this.”",
  "mn38:6.9": "Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: ",
  "mn38:6.10": "“Mendicants, do you understand my teachings as Sāti does, when he misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and makes much bad karma?”",
  "mn38:6.11": "“No, sir.",
  "mn38:6.12": "For in many ways the Buddha has told us that consciousness is dependently originated, since consciousness does not arise without a cause.”",
  "mn38:6.13": "“Good, good, mendicants!",
  "mn38:6.14": "It’s good that you understand my teaching like this.",
  "mn38:6.15": "For in many ways I have told you that consciousness is dependently originated, since consciousness does not arise without a cause.",
  "mn38:6.16": "But still this Sāti misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and makes much bad karma.",
  "mn38:6.17": "This will be for his lasting harm and suffering.",
  "mn38:7.1": "Consciousness is reckoned according the specific conditions dependent upon which it arises.",

  "mn38:7.6": "Consciousness that arises dependent on the body and touches is reckoned as body consciousness.",
  "mn38:7.7": "Consciousness that arises dependent on the mind and phenomena is reckoned as mind consciousness.",
  "mn38:8.1": "It’s like fire, which is reckoned according to the specific conditions dependent upon which it burns.",
  "mn38:8.2": "A fire that burns dependent on logs is reckoned as a log fire.",
  "mn38:8.3": "A fire that burns dependent on twigs is reckoned as a twig fire.",
  "mn38:8.4": "A fire that burns dependent on grass is reckoned as a grass fire.",
  "mn38:8.5": "A fire that burns dependent on cowdung is reckoned as a cowdung fire.",
  "mn38:8.6": "A fire that burns dependent on husks is reckoned as a husk fire.",
  "mn38:8.7": "A fire that burns dependent on rubbish is reckoned as a rubbish fire.",
  "mn38:8.8": "In the same way, consciousness is reckoned according the specific conditions dependent upon which it arises. …",
