They do not guard their sense doors or eat in moderation, and they are not committed to wakefulness. They don’t care about the ascetic life, and don’t keenly respect the training. They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, lazy, and lacking energy. They’re unmindful, lacking situational awareness and convergence, with straying minds, witless and stupid. Venerable Sāriputta planes their faults with this explanation of the teaching as if he knows my heart with his heart!",

They care about the ascetic life, and keenly respect the training. They’re not indulgent or slack, nor are they leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion. They’re energetic and determined. They’re mindful, with situational awareness and convergence, with unified mind, wise, not stupid. Hearing this explanation of the teaching from Venerable Sāriputta, they drink it up and devour it, as it were. And in speech and thought they say:",
