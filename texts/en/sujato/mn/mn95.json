  "mn95:3.3": "He stayed on in a sal grove to the north of Opāsāda called the “Gods’ Grove”.",
  "mn95:3.4": "Now at that time the brahmin Caṅkī was living in Opāsāda. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of grass, wood, water, and grain, a royal endowment of the highest quality.",
  "mn95:3.5": "The brahmins and householders of Opāsāda heard:",
  "mn95:3.6": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Opāsāda together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. He is staying in the God’s Grove to the north.",
  "mn95:3.7": "He has this good reputation:",
  "mn95:3.8": "‘That Blessed One is perfect, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme trainer of people, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’",
  "mn95:3.9": "He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.",
  "mn95:3.10": "He teaches Dharma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.",
  "mn95:3.11": "It’s good to see such perfected ones.”",
  "mn95:4.1": "Then, having departed Opāsāda, they formed into companies and headed north to the God’s Grove.",
  "mn95:4.2": "Now at that time the brahmin Caṅkī had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday rest.",
  "mn95:4.3": "He saw the brahmins and householders heading for the God’s Grove,",
  "mn95:4.4": "and addressed his steward:",

  "mn95:4.14": "“Yes, sir,” replied the stweard, and did as he was asked.",
  "mn95:5.1": "Now at that time five hundred brahmins from abroad were residing in Opāsāda on some business.",
  "mn95:5.2": "They heard that",
  "mn95:5.3": "the brahmin Caṅkī was going to see the ascetic Gotama.",
  "mn95:5.4": "They approached Caṅkī",
  "mn95:5.5": "and said to him:",

  "mn95:25.2": "And any ascetic or brahmin who comes to stay in our village district is our guest,",
  "mn95:25.3": "and should be honored and respected as such.",
  "mn95:25.6": "For this reason it’s not appropriate for Master Gotama to come to see me,",
  "mn95:25.7": "rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him.",
  "mn95:25.8": "This is the extent of Master Gotama’s praise that I have learned. But his praises are not confined to this,",
  "mn95:25.9": "for the praise of Master Gotama is limitless.",
  "mn95:25.10": "The possession of even a single one of these factors makes it inappropriate for Master Gotama to come to see me,",

  "mn95:25.12": "Well then, gentlemen, let’s all go to see the ascetic Gotama.”",
  "mn95:26.1": "Then Caṅkī together with a large group of brahmins went to the Buddha",
  "mn95:26.2": "and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "mn95:26.3": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.",
  "mn95:26.4": "Now at that time the Buddha was sitting engaged in some polite conversation together with some very senior brahmins.",
  "mn95:26.5": "Now at that time the brahmin student Kāpaṭika was sitting in that assembly. He was young, just tonsured; he was sixteen years old. He was an expert in the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philology and grammar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.",
  "mn95:26.6": "While the senior brahmins were conversing together with the Buddha, he interrupted.",
  "mn95:26.7": "Then the Buddha rebuked Kāpaṭika:",
  "mn95:26.8": "“Venerable Bhāradvāja, don’t interrupt the senior brahmins.",
  "mn95:26.9": "Wait until they’ve finished speaking.”",
  "mn95:26.10": "When he had spoken, Caṅkī said to the Buddha:",
  "mn95:26.11": "“Master Gotama, don’t rebuke the student Kāpaṭika.",
  "mn95:26.12": "He’s from a respectable family, and is learned, astute, a good speaker. He’s capable of having a dialogue with Master Gotama about this.” ",
  "mn95:26.13": "Then it occurred to the Buddha:",
  "mn95:26.14": "“Clearly the student Kāpaṭika will talk about the scriptural heritage of the three Vedas.",
  "mn95:26.15": "That’s why they put him at the front.”",
  "mn95:26.16": "Then Kāpaṭika thought:",
  "mn95:26.17": "“When the ascetic Gotama looks at me, I’ll ask him a question.”",
  "mn95:26.18": "Then the Buddha, knowing what Kāpaṭika was thinking, looked at him.",
  "mn95:27.1": "Then Kāpaṭika thought:",
  "mn95:27.2": "“The ascetic Gotama is concentrating on me.",
  "mn95:27.3": "Why don’t I ask him a question?”",
  "mn95:27.4": "Then he said:",
  "mn95:27.5": "“Master Gotama, regarding that which by the lineage of testament and by canonical authority is the ancient hymnal of the brahmins, the brahmins come to the definite conclusion:",
  "mn95:27.6": "‘This is the only truth, other ideas are stupid.’",
  "mn95:27.7": "What do you say about this?”",
  "mn95:27.8": "“Well, Bhāradvāja, is there even a single one of the brahmins who says this:",
  "mn95:27.9": "‘I know this, I see this:",
  "mn95:27.10": "this is the only truth, other ideas are stupid’?”",
  "mn95:27.11": "“No, Master Gotama.”",
  "mn95:27.12": "“Well, is there even a single teacher of the brahmins, or a teacher’s teacher back to the seventh generation, who says this:",
  "mn95:27.13": "‘I know this, I see this:",
  "mn95:27.14": "this is the only truth, other ideas are stupid’?”",
  "mn95:27.15": "“No, Master Gotama.”",
  "mn95:27.16": "“Well, what of the brahmin seers of the past, namely Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu? They were the authors and propagators of the hymns, whose hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times. These days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it. They continue chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught.",
  "mn95:27.17": "Did even they say:",
  "mn95:27.18": "‘We know this, we see this:",
  "mn95:27.19": "this is the only truth, other ideas are stupid’?”",
  "mn95:27.20": "“No, Master Gotama.”",
  "mn95:28.1": "“So, Bhāradvāja, it seems that there is not a single one of the brahmins,",
  "mn95:28.4": "nor a teacher’s teacher back to the seventh generation,",
  "mn95:28.7": "nor even the brahmin seers of the past",
  "mn95:28.8": "who says:",
  "mn95:28.9": "‘We know this, we see this:",
  "mn95:28.10": "this is the only truth, other ideas are stupid.’",
  "mn95:29.1": "Suppose there was a queue of blind men, each holding the one in front: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.",
  "mn95:29.2": "In the same way, it seems to me that the brahmins’ statement turns out to be comparable to a queue of blind men:",
  "mn95:29.3": "the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.",
  "mn95:29.4": "What do you think, Bhāradvāja? This being so, doesn’t the brahmins’ faith turn out to be baseless?”",
  "mn95:29.5": "“The brahmins don’t just honor this because of faith, but also because of oral transmission.”",
  "mn95:29.6": "“First you relied on faith, now you speak of oral tradition.",
  "mn95:29.7": "These five things can be seen to turn out in two different ways.",
  "mn95:29.8": "What five?",
  "mn95:29.9": "Faith, personal preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, and acceptance of a view after consideration.",
  "mn95:29.11": "Even though you have full faith in something, it may be void, hollow, and false.",
  "mn95:29.12": "And even if you don’t have full faith in something, it may be true and real, not otherwise.",
  "mn95:29.13": "Even though you have a strong preference for something …",
  "mn95:29.15": "something may be accurately transmitted …",
  "mn95:29.17": "something may be well contemplated …",
  "mn95:29.19": "something may be well considered, it may be void, hollow, and false.",
  "mn95:29.20": "And even if something is not well contemplated, it may be true and real, not otherwise.",
  "mn95:29.21": "For a sensible person who is preserving truth this is not sufficient to come to the definite conclusion:",
  "mn95:29.22": "‘This is the only truth, other ideas are stupid.’”",
  "mn95:30.1": "“But Master Gotama, how do you define the preservation of truth?”",
  "mn95:30.3": "“If a person has faith,",
  "mn95:30.4": "they preserve truth by saying, ‘Such is my faith.’",
  "mn95:30.5": "But they don’t yet come to the definite conclusion:",
  "mn95:30.6": "‘This is the only truth, other ideas are stupid.’",
  "mn95:30.7": "If a person has a preference …",
  "mn95:30.9": "or has received an oral transmission …",
  "mn95:30.11": "or has a reasoned reflection about something …",
  "mn95:30.13": "or has accepted a view after contemplation,",

  "mn95:30.16": "‘This is the only truth, other ideas are stupid.’",
  "mn95:30.17": "That’s how the preservation of truth is defined, Bhāradvāja. I describe the preservation of truth as defined in this way.",
  "mn95:30.18": "But this is not yet the awakening to the truth.”",
  "mn95:31.1": "“That’s how the preservation of truth is defined, Master Gotama. We regard the preservation of truth as defined in this way.",
  "mn95:31.2": "But Master Gotama, how do you define awakening to the truth?”",
  "mn95:31.4": "“Bhāradvāja, take the case of a mendicant living supported by a town or village.",
  "mn95:31.5": "A householder or their child approaches and searches them for three kinds of things:",
