  "mn70:3.2": "At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kāsīs together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.",
  "mn70:3.3": "There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:",
  "mn70:3.4": "“Mendicants, I abstain from eating at night.",
  "mn70:3.5": "Doing so, I find that I’m healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.",
  "mn70:3.6": "You too should abstain from eating at night.",
  "mn70:3.7": "Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”",
  "mn70:3.8": "“Yes, sir,” they replied.",
  "mn70:3.9": "Then the Buddha, travelling stage by stage in the land of the Kāsīs, arrived at a town of the Kāsīs named Kīṭāgiri,",
  "mn70:3.10": "and stayed on there.",
  "mn70:4.1": "Now at that time the mendicants who followed Assaji and Punabbasuka were residing at Kīṭāgiri.",
  "mn70:4.2": "Then several mendicants went up to them",
  "mn70:4.3": "and said:",
  "mn70:4.4": "“Reverends, the Buddha abstains from eating at night, and so does the mendicant Saṅgha.",
  "mn70:4.5": "Doing so, they find that they’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.",
  "mn70:4.6": "You too should abstain from eating at night.",
  "mn70:4.7": "Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”",
  "mn70:4.8": "When they said this, the mendicants who followed Assaji and Punabbasuka said to them:",
  "mn70:4.9": "“Reverends, we eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.",
  "mn70:4.10": "Doing so, we find that we’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.",
  "mn70:4.11": "Why should we give up what we see in the present to chase after what takes time?",
  "mn70:4.12": "We shall eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.”",
  "mn70:5.1": "Since those mendicants were unable to convince the mendicants who were followers of Assaji and Punabbasuka, they approached the Buddha,",
  "mn70:5.2": "bowed, sat down to one side, ",
  "mn70:5.3": "and told him what had happened. Then they said:",
  "mn70:6.1": "So the Buddha said to a certain monk:",
  "mn70:6.2": "“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicants who follow Assaji and Punabbasuka that",
  "mn70:6.3": "the teacher calls them.”",
  "mn70:6.4": "“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to those mendicants",
  "mn70:6.5": "and said:",
  "mn70:6.6": "“Venerables, the teacher calls you.”",
  "mn70:6.7": "“Yes, reverend,” those mendicants replied. They went to the Buddha,",
  "mn70:6.8": "bowed, and sat down to one side.",
  "mn70:6.9": "The Buddha said to them:",
  "mn70:6.10": "“Is it really true, mendicants, that several mendicants went to you and said:",
  "mn70:6.11": "‘Reverends, the Buddha abstains from eating at night, and so does the mendicant Saṅgha.",
  "mn70:6.12": "Doing so, they find that they’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.",
  "mn70:6.13": "You too should abstain from eating at night.",
  "mn70:6.14": "Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.’",
  "mn70:6.15": "When they said this, did you really say to them:",
  "mn70:6.16": "‘Reverends, we eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.",
  "mn70:6.17": "Doing so, we find that we’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.",
  "mn70:6.18": "Why should we give up what we see in the present to chase after what takes time?",
  "mn70:6.19": "We shall eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.’”",
  "mn70:6.20": "“Yes, sir.”",
  "mn70:7.1": "“Mendicants, have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma like this: no matter what this individual experiences—pleasurable, painful, or neutral—their unskillful qualities decline and their skillful qualities grow?”",
  "mn70:7.2": "“No, sir.”",
  "mn70:7.3": "“Haven’t you known me to teach the Dhamma like this: ‘When someone feels this kind of pleasant feeling, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline. But when someone feels that kind of pleasant feeling, unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow. When someone feels this kind of painful feeling, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline. But when someone feels that kind of painful feeling, unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow. When someone feels this kind of neutral feeling, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline. But when someone feels that kind of neutral feeling, unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow’?”",
  "mn70:7.4": "“Yes, sir.”",
  "mn70:8.1": "“Good, mendicants! ",
  "mn70:8.2": "Now, suppose I hadn’t known, seen, understood, realized, and experienced this with wisdom:",
