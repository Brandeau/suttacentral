  "mn68:2.1": "At Naḷakapāna",
  "mn68:3.1": "<span class=”evam”>So I have heard.</span>",
  "mn68:3.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans near Naḷakapāna in the parrot tree grove.",
  "mn68:3.3": "Now at that time several very well-known members of respectable families had gone forth from the lay life into homelessness out of faith in the Buddha—",
  "mn68:3.4": "Venerables Anuruddha, Bhaddiya, Kimbila, Bhagu, Koṇḍañña, Revata, Ānanda, and other very well-known respectable persons.",
  "mn68:3.5": "Now at that time the Buddha was sitting in the open, surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.",
  "mn68:3.6": "Then the Buddha spoke to the mendicants about those respectable persons: ",
  "mn68:3.7": "“Mendicants, those respectable persons who have gone forth from the lay life into homelessness out of faith in me—I hope they’re satisfied with the spiritual life?”",
  "mn68:3.8": "When this was said, the mendicants kept silent.",
  "mn68:4.1": "For a second and a third time the Buddha asked the same question.",
  "mn68:5.3": "For a third time, the mendicants kept silent.",
  "mn68:6.1": "Then it occurred to the Buddha:",
  "mn68:6.2": "“Why don’t I question just those respectable persons?”",
  "mn68:6.3": "Then the Buddha said to Venerable Anuruddha: ",
  "mn68:6.4": "“Anuruddha and friends, I hope you’re satisfied with the spiritual life?”",
  "mn68:6.5": "“Indeed, sir, we are satisfied with the spiritual life.”",
  "mn68:6.6": "“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!",
  "mn68:6.7": "It’s appropriate for respectable persons like yourselves, who have gone forth in faith from the lay life into homelessness, to be satisfied with the spiritual life.",
  "mn68:6.8": "Since you’re blessed with youth, in the prime of life, black-haired, you could have enjoyed sensual pleasures; yet you have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness.",
  "mn68:6.9": "But you didn’t go forth because you were forced to by kings or bandits, or because you’re in debt or threatened, or to earn a living.",
  "mn68:6.10": "Rather, didn’t you go forth thinking: ‘I’m overwhelmed by birth, old age, and death; by sorrow, crying, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m overwhelmed by suffering, mired in suffering.",
  "mn68:6.11": "Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering’?”",
  "mn68:7.1": "“Yes, sir.” ",
  "mn68:8.1": "“But, Anuruddha and friends, when a respectable person has gone forth like this, what should they do?",
  "mn68:8.2": "Take someone who doesn’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual stimuli and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that. Their mind is still occupied by desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, doubt, dissatisfaction, and sloth. ",
  "mn68:8.3": "That’s someone who doesn’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual stimuli and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that.",
  "mn68:9.1": "Take someone who does achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual stimuli and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that. Their mind is not occupied by desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, doubt, dissatisfaction, and sloth. ",
  "mn68:9.2": "That’s someone who does achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual stimuli and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that.",
  "mn68:10.1": "Is this what you think of me?",
  "mn68:10.2": "‘The Realized One has not given up the defilements, the corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful, resulting in suffering and future birth, old age, and death.",
  "mn68:10.3": "That’s why, after reflection, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things.’”",
  "mn68:11.1": "“No sir, we don’t think of you that way.",
  "mn68:11.4": "We think of you this way:",
  "mn68:11.5": "‘The Realized One has given up the defilements, the corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful, resulting in suffering and future birth, old age, and death.",
  "mn68:11.6": "That’s why, after reflection, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things.’”",
  "mn68:12.1": "“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!",
  "mn68:12.2": "The Realized One has given up the defilements—corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful, resulting in suffering and future birth, old age, and death. He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, exterminated them so they are unable to arise in the future.",
  "mn68:12.3": "Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth,",
  "mn68:12.4": "in the same way, the Realized One has given up the defilements so they are unable to arise in the future.",
  "mn68:12.5": "That’s why, after reflection, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things.",
  "mn68:13.1": "What do you think, Anuruddha and friends? What advantage does the Realized One see in declaring the rebirth of his disciples who have passed away: ",
  "mn68:13.2": "‘This one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there’?”",
  "mn68:13.3": " ",
  "mn68:14.1": "“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and refuge.",
  "mn68:14.2": "Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this.",
  "mn68:14.3": "The mendicants will listen and remember it.”",
  "mn68:15.1": "“The Realized One does not declare such things for the sake of deceiving people or flattering them, nor for the benefit of possessions, honor, or popularity, nor thinking, ‘So let people know about me!’",
  "mn68:15.3": "Rather, there are respectable persons of faith who are full of sublime joy and gladness.",
  "mn68:15.4": "When they hear that, they apply their minds to that end.",
  "mn68:15.5": "That is for their lasting welfare and happiness.",
  "mn68:16.1": "Take a monk who hears this:",
  "mn68:16.2": "‘The monk named so-and-so has died.",

  "mn68:16.5": "And he’s either seen for himself, or heard from someone else, that that venerable",
  "mn68:16.6": "had such ethics, such qualities, such wisdom, such meditation, or such freedom.",
  "mn68:16.7": "Recollecting that monk’s faith, ethics, learning, generosity, wisdom, he applies his mind to that end.",
  "mn68:16.8": "That’s how a monk lives at ease.",
  "mn68:17.1": "Take a monk who hears this:",
  "mn68:17.2": "‘The monk named so-and-so has died.",
  "mn68:17.3": "The Buddha has declared that,",
