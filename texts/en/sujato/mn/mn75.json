  "mn75:3.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma, on a grass mat in the fire chamber of a brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan.",
  "mn75:3.3": "Then the Buddha got dressed in the morning and, taking his bowl and robes, entered Kammāsadamma for alms.",
  "mn75:3.4": "He wandered for alms in Kammāsadamma. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to a certain forest grove for the day’s meditation.",
  "mn75:3.5": "Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree for the day’s meditation.",
  "mn75:3.6": "Then as the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya was going for a walk he approached that fire chamber.",
  "mn75:3.7": "He saw the grass mat spread out there",
  "mn75:3.8": "and asked the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan:",
  "mn75:3.9": "“Mister Bhāradvāja, who has this grass mat been spread out for? It looks like an ascetic’s bed.”",
  "mn75:3.10": "“There is the ascetic Gotama, a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family.",
  "mn75:3.11": "He has this good reputation: ",
  "mn75:3.12": "‘That Blessed One is perfect, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme trainer of people, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’",
  "mn75:3.13": "This bed has been spread for that Master Gotama.”",
  "mn75:3.14": "“Well, it’s a sad sight, Mister Bhāradvāja,",
  "mn75:3.15": "a very sad sight indeed,",
  "mn75:3.16": "to see a bed for Master Gotama, that life-destroyer!”",
  "mn75:3.17": "“Be careful what you say, Māgaṇḍiya,",
  "mn75:3.18": "be careful what you say.",
  "mn75:3.19": "Many astute aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics are full of confidence in Master Gotama. They’ve been guided by him in the noble procedure, the skillful teaching.”",
  "mn75:3.20": "“Even if I was to see Master Gotama face to face, Mister Bhāradvāja, I would say to his face:",
  "mn75:3.21": "‘The ascetic Gotama is a life-destroyer.’",
  "mn75:3.22": "Why is that?",
  "mn75:3.23": "Because that’s what it implies in a discourse of ours.”",
  "mn75:3.24": "“If you don’t mind, I’ll tell the ascetic Gotama about this.”",
  "mn75:3.25": "“Don’t worry, Mister Bharadvāja. You may tell him exactly what I’ve said.”",
  "mn75:4.1": "With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard this discussion between the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan and the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya.",
  "mn75:4.2": "Coming out of solitude, he went to the brahmin’s fire chamber",
  "mn75:4.3": "and sat on the grass mat.",
  "mn75:4.4": "Then the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan went to the Buddha",
  "mn75:4.5": "and exchanged greetings with him.",
  "mn75:4.6": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.",
  "mn75:4.7": "The Buddha said to him:",
  "mn75:4.8": "“Bhāradvāja, did you have a discussion with the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya about this grass mat?”",
  "mn75:4.9": "When he said this, the brahmin said to the Buddha:",
  "mn75:4.10": "“I wanted to mention this very thing to Master Gotama,",
  "mn75:4.11": "but you brought it up before I had a chance.”",
  "mn75:4.12": "But this conversation between the Buddha and the brahmin was left unfinished.",
  "mn75:4.13": "Then as the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya was going for a walk he approached that fire chamber. He went up to the Buddha,",
  "mn75:4.14": "and exchanged greetings with him.",
  "mn75:4.15": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,",
  "mn75:4.16": "and the Buddha said to him:",
  "mn75:5.1": "“Māgaṇḍiya, the eye likes sights, it loves them and enjoys them.",
  "mn75:5.2": "That’s been tamed, guarded, protected and restrained by the Realized One, and he teaches Dhamma for its restraint.",

  "mn75:5.4": "a life-destroyer?”",
  "mn75:5.5": "“That’s exactly what I was referring to.",

  "mn75:6.3": "The nose likes smells …",
  "mn75:6.4": "The tongue likes tastes …",
  "mn75:7.1": "The body likes touches …",
  "mn75:7.3": "The mind likes phenomena, it loves them and enjoys them.",
  "mn75:7.4": "That’s been tamed, guarded, protected and restrained by the Realized One, and he teaches Dhamma for its restraint.",

  "mn75:8.2": "Take someone who used to amuse themselves with sights cognizable by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Some time later—having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of sights, and having given up craving and dispelling passion for sights—they would live rid of thirst, their mind peaceful inside.",
  "mn75:8.3": "What would you have to say to them, Māgaṇḍiya?”",
  "mn75:8.4": "“Nothing, Master Gotama.”",
  "mn75:9.1": "“What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya?",

  "mn75:10.6": "I had three stilt longhouses—",
  "mn75:10.7": "one for the rainy season, one for the winter, and one for the summer.",
  "mn75:10.8": "I stayed in a stilt longhouse without coming downstairs for the four months of the rainy season, where I was entertained by musicians—none of them men.",
  "mn75:10.9": "Some time later—having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of sensual pleasures, and having given up craving and dispelled passion for sensual pleasures—I live rid of thirst, their mind peaceful inside.",
  "mn75:10.10": "I see other sentient beings who are not free from sensual pleasures being consumed by craving for sensual pleasures, burning with passion for sensual pleasures, indulging in sensual pleasures.",
  "mn75:10.11": "I don’t envy them, nor do I hope to enjoy that.",
  "mn75:10.12": "Why is that?",
  "mn75:10.13": "Because there is a satisfaction that is apart from sensual stimuli and unskillful qualities,",
  "mn75:10.14": "and which even achieves the level of heavenly pleasure.",
  "mn75:10.15": "Enjoying that satisfaction, I don’t envy what is inferior, nor do I hope to enjoy it.",
  "mn75:11.1": "Suppose there was a householder or a householder’s child who was rich, affluent, and wealthy. And they would amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. That is, sights cognizable by the eye … ",

  "mn75:11.4": "Having practiced good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, when their body breaks up, after death, they’d be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the Thirty-three",
  "mn75:11.5": "There they’d amuse themselves in the Garden of Delight, escorted by a band of nymphs, supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation.",
  "mn75:11.6": "Then they’d see a householder or a householder’s child amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.",

Would that god—amusing themselves in the Garden of Delight, escorted by a band of nymphs, supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation—envy that householder or householder’s child their five kinds of human sensual stimulation, or return to human sensual pleasures?”",
  "mn75:12.2": "“No, Master Gotama.”",
  "mn75:12.3": "Why is that?",
  "mn75:12.4": "Because heavenly sensual pleasures are better than human sensual pleasures.”",
  "mn75:13.1": "“In the same way, when I was still a layperson I used to entertain myself with sights … sounds …",

  "mn75:14.3": "The field surgeon would make medicine for them,",
  "mn75:14.4": "and by using that they’d be cured of leprosy. They’d be healthy, happy, autonomous, master of themselves, able to go where they wanted.",

  "mn75:15.1": "What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya? Would that person envy that other person affected by leprosy for their pit of glowing coals or for taking medicine?”",
  "mn75:15.2": "“No, Master Gotama.",
  "mn75:15.3": "Why is that?",
  "mn75:15.4": "Because you need to take medicine only when there’s a disease. When there’s no disease, there’s no need for medicine.”",

  "mn75:18.1": "What do you think, householder? Wouldn’t that person writhe and struggle to and fro?”",
  "mn75:18.2": "“Yes, Master Gotama.",
  "mn75:18.3": "Why is that?",
  "mn75:18.4": "Because that fire is really painful to touch, fiercely burning and scorching.”",
  "mn75:19.1": "“What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya? Is it only now that that fire is really painful to touch, fiercely burning and scorching, or was it painful previously as well?”",
  "mn75:19.2": "“That fire is painful now and it was also painful previously.",
  "mn75:19.3": "That person was affected by leprosy, with sores and blisters on their limbs. Being devoured by worms, scratching with their nails at the opening of their wounds, their sense faculties were impaired. So even though the fire was actually painful to touch, they had a distorted perception that it was pleasant.”",

  "mn75:21.4": "In the same way, I see other sentient beings who are not free from sensual pleasures being consumed by craving for sensual pleasures, burning with passion for sensual pleasures, indulging in sensual pleasures.",
  "mn75:21.5": "The more they indulge in sensual pleasures, the more their craving for sensual pleasures grows, and the more they burn with passion for sensual pleasures. But still, they derive a degree of pleasure and gratification",
  "mn75:21.6": "from the five kinds of sensual stimulation.",
  "mn75:22.1": "What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya? Have you seen or heard of a king or a royal minister of the past, future, or present, amusing themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, who—without giving up craving for sensual pleasures and dispelling passion for sensual pleasures—lives rid of thirst, their mind peaceful inside?”",
  "mn75:22.2": "“No, Master Gotama.”",
  "mn75:23.1": "“Good, Māgaṇḍiya.",
  "mn75:23.2": "Neither have I.",
  "mn75:23.3": "On the contrary, all the ascetics or brahmins of the past, future, or present who live rid of thirst, their minds peaceful inside, do so after truly understanding the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of sensual pleasures, and after giving up craving and dispelling passion for sensual pleasures.”",
