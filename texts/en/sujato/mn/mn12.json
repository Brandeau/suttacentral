  "mn12:47.1": "And this is what my rough living was like.",
  "mn12:47.2": "The dust and dirt built up on my body over many years until it started flaking off.",
  "mn12:47.3": "It’s like the trunk of a pale-moon ebony tree, which builds up bark over many years until it starts flaking off.",
  "mn12:47.4": "But it didn’t occur to me:",
  "mn12:47.5": "‘Oh, this dust and dirt must be rubbed off by my hand or another’s.’",
  "mn12:47.6": "That didn’t occur to me.",
  "mn12:47.7": "Such was my rough living.",
  "mn12:48.1": "And this is what my practice of shunning was like.",
  "mn12:48.2": "I’d step forward or back ever so mindfully. I was full of pity even regarding a drop of water, thinking:",
  "mn12:48.3": "‘May I not accidentally injure any little creatures that happen to be in the wrong place.’",
  "mn12:48.4": "Such was my practice of shunning.",
  "mn12:49.1": "And this is what my seclusion was like.",
  "mn12:49.2": "I would plunge deep into a wilderness region and stay there.",
  "mn12:49.3": "When I saw a cowherd or a shepherd, or someone gathering grass or sticks, or a lumberjack, I’d flee from forest to forest, from thicket to thicket, from valley to valley, from uplands to uplands.",
  "mn12:49.4": "Why is that?",
  "mn12:49.5": "So that I wouldn’t see them, nor they me.",
  "mn12:49.6": "I fled like a wild deer seeing a human being.",
  "mn12:49.10": "Such was my practice of seclusion.",
  "mn12:50.1": "I would go on all fours into the cow-pens after the cattle had left and eat the dung of the young suckling calves.",
  "mn12:50.2": "As long as my own urine and excrement lasted, I would even eat that.",
  "mn12:50.3": "Such was my eating of most unnatural things.",
  "mn12:51.1": "I would plunge deep into an awe-inspiring forest grove and stay there.",
  "mn12:51.2": "It was so awe-inspiring that ",
  "mn12:51.3": "normally it’d make your hair stand on end if you weren’t free of greed.",
  "mn12:51.4": "And on cold nights like the eight days of winter when the snow falls I stayed in the open by night and in the forest by day.",
  "mn12:51.5": "But in the last month of summer I’d stay in the open by day and in the forest by night.",
  "mn12:51.6": "And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me:",
  "mn12:52.1": "‘Scorched and frozen,",
  "mn12:52.2": "alone in the awe-inspiring forest.",
  "mn12:52.3": "Naked, no fire to sit beside,",
  "mn12:52.4": "the sage still pursues his quest.’",
  "mn12:53.1": "I would make my bed in a charnel ground, with the bones of the dead for a pillow.",
  "mn12:53.2": "Then the cowboys would come up to me. They’d spit and piss on me, throw mud on me, even poke sticks in my ears.",
  "mn12:53.3": "But I don’t recall ever having a bad thought about them.",
  "mn12:53.4": "Such was my abiding in equanimity.",
  "mn12:54.1": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:",
  "mn12:54.2": "‘Purity comes from food.’",
  "mn12:54.3": "They say:",
  "mn12:54.4": "‘Let’s live on jujubes.’",
  "mn12:54.5": "So they eat jujubes and jujube powder, and drink jujube juice.",
  "mn12:54.6": "And they enjoy many jujube concoctions.",
  "mn12:54.7": "I recall eating just a single jujube.",
  "mn12:54.8": "You might think that",
  "mn12:54.9": "at that time the jujubes must have been very big.",
  "mn12:54.10": "But you should not see it like this.",
  "mn12:54.11": "The jujubes then were at most the same size as today.",
  "mn12:54.12": "Eating so very little, my body became extremely emaciated.",
  "mn12:54.13": "Due to eating so little, my limbs became like the joints of an eighty year old or a corpse,",
  "mn12:54.14": " ",
  "mn12:54.15": "my bottom became like a camel’s hoof,",
  "mn12:54.17": "my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string,",
  "mn12:54.19": "and my ribs were as gaunt as the broken-down rafters on an old barn.",
  "mn12:54.21": "Due to eating so little, the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets, like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well.",
  "mn12:54.23": "Due to eating so little, my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter-gourd in the wind and sun.",
  "mn12:54.25": "Due to eating so little, the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone, so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly.",
  "mn12:54.26": "Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there.",
  "mn12:54.27": "Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out.",
  "mn12:55.1": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:",
  "mn12:55.2": "‘Purity comes from food.’",
  "mn12:55.3": "They say:",
  "mn12:55.4": "‘Let’s live on mung beans.’ …",
  "mn12:55.6": "‘Let’s live on sesame.’ …",
  "mn12:55.8": "‘Let’s live on ordinary rice.’ …",
  "mn12:55.32": "Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out.",
  "mn12:56.1": "But Sāriputta, I did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by that conduct, that practice, that grueling work.",
  "mn12:56.2": "Why is that?",
  "mn12:56.3": "Because I didn’t achieve that noble wisdom that’s noble and emancipating, and which leads someone who practices it to the complete ending of suffering.",
  "mn12:57.1": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:",
  "mn12:57.2": "‘Purity comes from transmigration.’",
  "mn12:57.3": "But it’s not easy to find any realm that I haven’t previously transmigrated to in all this long time, except for the gods of the pure abodes.",
  "mn12:57.4": "For if I had transmigrated to the gods of the pure abodes I would not have returned to this realm again.",
  "mn12:58.1": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:",
  "mn12:58.2": "‘Purity comes from rebirth.’",
  "mn12:58.3": "But it’s not easy to find any rebirth that I haven’t previously been reborn in …",
  "mn12:59.1": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:",
  "mn12:59.2": "‘Purity comes from abode of rebirth.’",
  "mn12:59.3": "But it’s not easy to find an abode that I haven’t previously abided in …",
  "mn12:60.1": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:",
  "mn12:60.2": "‘Purity comes from sacrifice.’",
  "mn12:60.3": "But it’s not easy to find a sacrifice that I haven’t previously offered in all this long time, when I was an anointed king or a propertied brahmin.",
  "mn12:61.1": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:",
  "mn12:61.2": "‘Purity comes from worshiping the sacred flame.’",
  "mn12:61.3": "But it’s not easy to find a fire that I haven’t previously worshiped in all this long time, when I was an anointed king or a propertied brahmin.",
  "mn12:62.1": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:",
  "mn12:62.2": "‘So long as this gentleman is youthful, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life he will be endowed with perfect proficiency in wisdom.",
  "mn12:62.3": "But when he’s old, elderly, and senior, has lived long and reached the final stage of life—eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old—he will lose his proficiency in wisdom.’",
  "mn12:62.4": "But you should not see it like this.",
  "mn12:62.5": "For now I am old, elderly, and senior, I’ve lived long and reached the final stage of life. I am eighty years old.",
  "mn12:62.6": "Suppose I had four disciples with a lifespan of a hundred years. And they each were perfect in memory, range, retention, and perfect proficiency in wisdom.",
  "mn12:62.7": "Imagine how easily a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow would shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree. That’s how extraordinary they were in memory, range, retention, and perfect proficiency in wisdom.",
  "mn12:62.8": "They’d bring up questions about the four kinds of mindfulness meditation again and again, and I would answer each question. They’d remember the answers and not ask the same question twice.",
  "mn12:62.9": "And they’d pause only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness. But the Realized One would not run out of Dhamma teachings, words and phrases of the teachings, or spontaneous answers.",
  "mn12:62.10": "And at the end of a hundred years my four disciples would pass away.",
  "mn12:62.11": "Even if you have to carry me around on a stretcher, there will never be any deterioration in the Realized One’s proficiency in wisdom.",
  "mn12:62.12": "And if there’s anyone of whom it should be rightly said that",
  "mn12:62.13": "a being not liable to delusion has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of many people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans, it’s of me that this should be said.”",
  "mn12:63.1": "Now at that time Venerable Nāgasamāla was standing behind the Buddha fanning him.",
  "mn12:63.2": "Then he said to the Buddha:",
  "mn12:63.3": "“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!",
  "mn12:63.4": "While I was listening to this explanation of the teaching my hair stood up!",
  "mn12:63.5": "What is the name of this explanation of the teaching?”",
  "mn12:63.6": "“Well, Nāgasamāla, you may remember this explanation of the teaching as ‘The Hair-raising Discourse’.”",
  "mn12:64.1": "This is what the Buddha said.",
  "mn12:64.2": "Uplifted, Venerable Nāgasamāla approved of what the Buddha said. "
