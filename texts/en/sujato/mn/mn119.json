  "mn119:3.3": "Then after the meal, on return from alms-round, several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them.",
  "mn119:3.4": "“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing,",
  "mn119:3.5": "how the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the Perfect One, the fully awakened Buddha has said that mindfulness of the body, when developed and cultivated, is very fruitful and beneficial.”",
  "mn119:3.6": "But their conversation was left unfinished when the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the pavilion,",

  "mn119:3.9": "“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was unfinished?”",
  "mn119:3.10": "So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about when the Buddha arrived. The Buddha said:",
  "mn119:4.1": "“And how, mendicants, is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial? ",
  "mn119:4.2": "It’s when a mendicant, gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down in the meditation posture, with their body erect, and establishes mindfulness right there. ",
  "mn119:4.3": "Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.",
  "mn119:4.4": "When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’",

  "mn119:4.7": "They practice breathing in stilling the body’s motion. They practice breathing out stilling the body’s motion.",
  "mn119:4.8": "As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts of the lay life are given up.",
  "mn119:4.9": "Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and converges in samādhi.",
  "mn119:4.10": "That’s how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.",
  "mn119:5.1": "Furthermore, when a mendicant is walking they know ‘I am walking’. When standing they know ‘I am standing’. When sitting they know ‘I am sitting’. And when lying down they know ‘I am lying down’.",
  "mn119:5.2": "Whatever posture their body is in, they know it.",
  "mn119:5.3": "As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts of the lay life are given up.",

  "mn119:7.2": "‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentry, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’ ",
  "mn119:8.1": "It’s as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as",
  "mn119:8.2": "fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, sesame, and ordinary rice. And someone with good eyesight were to open it and examine the contents:",
  "mn119:8.3": "‘These grains are fine rice, these are wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, these are sesame, and these are ordinary rice.’",

  "mn119:9.2": "‘In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’",
  "mn119:10.1": "It’s as if a skilled butcher or butcher’s apprentice were to kill a cow and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into portions.",
  "mn119:10.2": "In the same way, a mendicant examines their own body, whatever its placement or posture, according to the elements:",

  "mn119:10.6": "That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.",
  "mn119:11.1": "Furthermore, suppose a mendicant were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering.",
  "mn119:11.2": "They’d compare it with their own body:",
  "mn119:11.3": "‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’",
  "mn119:11.4": "As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts of the lay life are given up.",
  "mn119:11.5": "Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and converges in samādhi.",
  "mn119:11.6": "That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.",
  "mn119:12.1": "Or suppose they were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, herons, dogs, tigers, leopards, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures.",
  "mn119:12.2": "They’d compare it with their own body:",
  "mn119:12.3": "‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’",
  "mn119:12.6": "That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.",
  "mn119:13.1": "Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together by sinews …",
  "mn119:13.3": "A skeleton without flesh but smeared with blood, and held together by sinews …",
  "mn119:13.5": "A skeleton rid of flesh and blood, held together by sinews …",
  "mn119:13.7": "Bones without sinews scattered in every direction. Here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here a shin-bone, there a thigh-bone, here a hip-bone, there a rib-bone, here a back-bone, there an arm-bone, here a neck-bone, there a jaw-bone, here a tooth, there the skull … ",

  "mn119:14.11": "That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.",
  "mn119:15.1": "Furthermore, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",
  "mn119:15.4": "They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.",
  "mn119:15.5": "It’s like when a skilled bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out.",
  "mn119:15.6": "In the same way, they drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.",

  "mn119:15.10": "That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.",
  "mn119:16.1": "Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of samādhi, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.

  "mn119:16.5": "There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of samādhi.",
  "mn119:16.6": "It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water.",
  "mn119:16.7": "There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and no rainfall to replenish it from time to time. ",
  "mn119:16.9": "But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water.",

  "mn119:16.13": "That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.",
  "mn119:17.1": "Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption. They meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss’. ",

  "mn119:17.5": "It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. From the tip to the root they’re drenched, steeped, filled, and spread through with cool water. There’s no part of them that’s not spread through with cool water.",

  "mn119:18.1": "Furthermore, a mendicant, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. ",
  "mn119:18.4": "They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind.",
  "mn119:18.5": "There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind.",
