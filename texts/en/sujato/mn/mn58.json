  "mn58:2.1": "With Prince Abhaya",
  "mn58:3.1": "<span class=”evam”>So I have heard.</span>",
  "mn58:3.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.",
  "mn58:3.3": "Then Prince Abhaya went up to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta,",
  "mn58:3.4": "bowed, and sat down to one side.",
  "mn58:3.5": "Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said to him:",
  "mn58:3.6": "“Come, prince, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.",
  "mn58:3.7": "Then you will get a good reputation:",
  "mn58:3.8": "‘Prince Abhaya refuted the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, so mighty and powerful!’",
  "mn58:3.9": "“But sir, how am I to do this?”",
  "mn58:3.10": "“Here, prince, go to the ascetic Gotama",
  "mn58:3.11": "and say to him:",
  "mn58:3.12": "‘Sir, might the Realized One utter speech that is disliked by others?’",
  "mn58:3.13": "When he’s asked this, if he answers:",
  "mn58:3.14": "‘He might, prince,’ say this to him:",
  "mn58:3.15": "‘Then, sir, what exactly is the difference between you and an ordinary person?",
  "mn58:3.16": "For even an ordinary person might utter speech that is disliked by others.’",
  "mn58:3.17": "But if he answers:",
  "mn58:3.18": "‘He would not, prince,’ say this to him:",
  "mn58:3.19": "‘Then, sir, why exactly did you declare of Devadatta:",
  "mn58:3.20": "“Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable”?",
  "mn58:3.21": "Devadatta was angry and upset with what you said.’",
  "mn58:3.22": "When you put this dilemma to him, the Buddha won’t be able to either spit it out or swallow it down.",
  "mn58:3.23": "He’ll be like a man with an iron cross stuck in his throat, unable to either spit it out or swallow it down.”",
  "mn58:3.25": "“Yes, sir,” replied Abhaya. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Buddha,",
  "mn58:3.26": "bowed, and sat down to one side.",
  "mn58:4.1": "Then he looked up at the sun and thought:",
  "mn58:4.2": "“It’s too late to refute the Buddha’s doctrine today.",
  "mn58:4.3": "I shall refute his doctrine in my own home tomorrow.” He said to the Buddha:",
  "mn58:4.4": "“Sir, may the Buddha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me, together with three other monks.”",
  "mn58:4.5": "The Buddha consented in silence.",
  "mn58:4.6": "Then, knowing that the Buddha had accepted, Abhaya got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.",
  "mn58:4.7": "Then when the night had passed, the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robes, went to Abhaya’s home,",
  "mn58:4.8": "and sat down on the indicated seat.",
  "mn58:4.9": "Then Abhaya served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.",
  "mn58:4.10": "When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Abhaya took a low seat, sat to one side,",
  "mn58:5.1": "and said to him:",
  "mn58:5.2": "“Sir, might the Realized One utter speech that is disliked by others?”",
  "mn58:5.3": "“This is no simple matter, prince.”",
  "mn58:5.4": "“Then the Jains have lost in this, sir.”",
  "mn58:5.5": "“But prince, why do you say that",
  "mn58:5.6": "the Jains have lost in this?”",
  "mn58:5.7": "Then Abhaya told the Buddha all that had happened.",
  "mn58:6.1": "Now at that time a little baby boy was sitting in Prince Abhaya’s lap. ",
  "mn58:6.2": "Then the Buddha said to Abhaya:",
  "mn58:6.3": "‘What do you think, prince? If—because of your negligence or his nurse’s negligence—your boy was to put a stick or stone in his mouth, what would you do to him?”",
  "mn58:6.4": "“I’d try to take it out, sir.",
  "mn58:6.5": "If that didn’t work, I’d hold his head with my left hand, and take it out using a hooked finger of my right hand, even if it drew blood.",
  "mn58:6.6": "Why is that?",
  "mn58:6.7": "Because I have compassion for the boy, sir.”",
  "mn58:6.8": "In the same way, prince, the Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be untrue, false, and harmful, and which is disliked by others.",
  "mn58:6.9": "The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be true and substantive, but which is harmful and disliked by others.",
  "mn58:6.10": "The Realized One knows the right time to speak so as to explain what he knows to be true, substantive, and beneficial, but which is disliked by others.",
  "mn58:6.11": "The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be untrue, false, and harmful, but which is liked by others.",
  "mn58:6.12": "The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be true and substantive, but which is harmful, even if it is liked by others.",
  "mn58:6.13": "The Realized One knows the right time to speak so as to explain what he knows to be true, substantive, and beneficial, and which is liked by others.",
  "mn58:6.14": "Why is that?",
  "mn58:6.15": "Because the Realized One has compassion for sentient beings.”",
  "mn58:7.1": "“Sir, there are clever aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics who come to see you with a question already planned. Do you think beforehand that if they ask you like this, you’ll answer like that, or does the answer just appear to you on the spot?”",
  "mn58:8.1": "“Well then, prince, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.",
  "mn58:8.2": "What do you think, prince? Are you skilled in the various parts of a chariot?”",
  "mn58:9.1": "“I am, sir.”",
  "mn58:10.1": "“What do you think, prince? When they come to you and ask:",
  "mn58:10.2": "‘What’s the name of this chariot part?’",
  "mn58:10.3": "Do you think beforehand that if they ask you like this, you’ll answer like that, or does the answer appear to you on the spot?”",
  "mn58:11.1": "“Sir, I’m well known as a charioteer skilled in a chariot’s parts.",
  "mn58:11.2": "All the parts are well known to me.",
  "mn58:11.3": "The answer just appears to me on the spot.”",
  "mn58:12.1": "“In the same way, when clever aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics come to see me with a question already planned, the answer just appears to me on the spot.",
  "mn58:12.2": "Why is that?",
  "mn58:12.3": "Because the Realized One has thoroughly penetrated the principle of the teachings because of which the answer just appears to him on the spot.”",
  "mn58:13.1": "When he had spoken, Prince Abhaya said to the Buddha: ",
  "mn58:13.2": "“Excellent, sir! Excellent! …",
  "mn58:13.4": "From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”"
