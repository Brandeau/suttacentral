  "mn94:14.3": "He has a new temple built to the east of the city. He shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in a rough antelope hide, and smears his body with ghee and oil. Scratching his back with antlers, he enters the temple with his chief queen and the brahmin high priest.",
  "mn94:14.4": "There he lies on the bare ground strewn with grass.",
  "mn94:14.5": "The king feeds on the milk from one teat of a cow that has a calf of the same color. The chief queen feeds on the milk from the second teat. The brahmin high priest feeds on the milk from the third teat. The milk from the fourth teat is offered to the flames. The calf feeds on the remainder.",
  "mn94:14.6": "He says:",

  "mn94:15.12": "After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the lay life into homelessness.",
  "mn94:15.13": "Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing violence and harming. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all creatures.",

  "mn94:26.1": "When they have this noble spectrum of ethics, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.",

  "mn94:27.1": "They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.

  "mn94:27.2": "As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of samādhi, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.  ",
  "mn94:27.3": "And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss’. ",

  "mn94:29.5": "They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.",
  "mn94:29.6": "These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind.",
  "mn94:29.8": "They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’",
  "mn94:29.9": "And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.",
  "mn94:30.1": "When his mind has unified in samādhi like this—purified, bright, spotless, rid of taints, pliable, workable, steady, and motionless—he turns it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.",
  "mn94:30.2": "They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. ",
  "mn94:30.3": "They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’. ",
  "mn94:30.4": "Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire for rebirth, and ignorance.",
  "mn94:30.5": "When freed, they know ‘it is freed’.",
  "mn94:30.6": "They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ ",
  "mn94:31.1": "This is called a person who neither mortifies themselves or others, being committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others.",
  "mn94:31.2": "They live without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, having become holy in themselves.”",
  "mn94:32.1": "When he had spoken, Ghoṭamukha said to him:",
