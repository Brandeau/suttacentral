  "mn97:3.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.",
  "mn97:3.3": "Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was wandering in the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.",
  "mn97:3.4": "Then a certain mendicant who had spent the rainy season in Rājagaha went to the Southern Hills, where he approached Venerable Sāriputta,",

  "mn97:3.6": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.",
  "mn97:3.7": "Sāriputta said to him:",
  "mn97:3.8": "“Reverend, I hope the Buddha is healthy and well?”",
  "mn97:3.9": "“He is, reverend.”",
  "mn97:3.10": "“And I hope that the mendicant Saṅgha is healthy and well.”",
  "mn97:3.11": "“It is.”",
  "mn97:3.12": "“Reverend, at the rice checkpoint there is a brahmin named Dhanañjani.",

  "mn97:3.14": "“He too is well.”",
  "mn97:3.15": "“But is he diligent?”",
  "mn97:3.16": "“How could he possibly be diligent?",
  "mn97:3.17": "Dhanañjāni robs the brahmins and householders in the name of the king, and he robs the king in the name of the brahmins and householders.",
  "mn97:3.18": "His wife, a lady of faith who he married from a family of faith, has passed away.",
  "mn97:3.19": "And he has taken a new wife who has no faith.”",
  "mn97:3.20": "“Oh, it’s bad news",
  "mn97:3.21": "to hear that Dhanañjāni is negligent.",
  "mn97:3.22": "Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet him, and we can have a discussion.”",
  "mn97:4.1": "Then Sāriputta—when he had stayed in the Southern Hills as long as he wished—set out for Rājagaha.",
  "mn97:4.2": "Travelling stage by stage, he arrived at Rājagaha,",
  "mn97:4.3": "where he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.",
  "mn97:4.4": "Then he got dressed in the morning and, taking his bowl and robes, entered Rājagaha for alms.",
  "mn97:4.5": "Now at that time Dhanañjāni was having his cows milked in a cow-shed outside the city.",
  "mn97:4.6": "Then Sāriputta wandered for alms in Rājagaha. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he approached Dhanañjāni.",

  "mn97:4.19": "Sāriputta said to him:",
  "mn97:4.20": "“I hope you’re diligent, Dhanañjāni?”",
  "mn97:4.21": "“How can I possibly be diligent, Master Sāriputta? I have to support my mother and father, my wife and children, and my slaves and workers. And I have to make the proper offerings to friends and colleagues, relatives and kin, guests, ancestors, gods, and king. And then this body must also be fattened and built up.”",
  "mn97:5.1": "“What do you think, Dhanañjāni? Suppose someone was to behave in an unprincipled and unjust way for the sake of their parents. Because of this the wardens of hell would drag them to hell.",

  "mn97:14.3": "“No, Master Sāriputta.",
  "mn97:14.4": "Rather, even as they were wailing the wardens of hell would cast them down into hell.”",
  "mn97:15.1": "“Who do you think is better, Dhanañjāni? Someone who, for the sake of their parents, behaves in an unprincipled and unjust manner, or someone who behaves in a principled and just manner?”",
  "mn97:15.3": "“Someone who behaves in a principled and just manner for the sake of their parents.",
  "mn97:15.5": "For principled and just conduct is better than unprincipled and unjust conduct.”",
  "mn97:15.6": "“Dhanañjāni, there are other livelihoods that are both profitable and legitimate. By means of these it’s possible to support your parents, avoid bad deeds, and practice the path of goodness.",

  "mn97:25.1": "Then Dhanañjāni the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat and left.",
  "mn97:25.2": "Some time later Dhanañjāni became sick, suffering, gravely ill.",

  "mn97:25.13": "‘Sir, please visit Dhanañjāni at his home out of compassion.’”",
  "mn97:25.14": "“Yes, sire,” that man replied. He did as Dhanañjāni asked.",
  "mn97:25.25": "Sāriputta consented in silence.",
  "mn97:26.1": "He robed up, and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Dhanañjāni’s home,",
  "mn97:26.2": "where he sat on the seat spread out",
  "mn97:26.3": "and said to Dhanañjāni:",
