  "mn76:3.1": "<span class=”evam”>So I have heard.</span>",
  "mn76:3.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.",
  "mn76:3.3": "Now at that time the wanderer Sandaka was residing at the cave of the wavy leaf fig tree together with a large assembly of five hundred wanderers.",
  "mn76:3.4": "Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Ānanda came out of solitude and addressed the mendicants:",
  "mn76:3.5": "“Come, reverends, let’s go to the Devakata Pool to see the cave.”",
  "mn76:3.6": "“Yes, reverend,” they replied.",
  "mn76:3.7": "Then Ānanda together with several mendicants went to the Devakata Pool.",
  "mn76:4.1": "Now at that time, Sandaka and the large assembly of wanderers were sitting together making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of crude talk, such as talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; miscellaneous talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.",
  "mn76:5.1": "Sandaka saw Ānanda coming off in the distance,",
  "mn76:5.2": "and hushed his own assembly:",
  "mn76:5.3": "“Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound.",
  "mn76:5.4": "The ascetic Ānanda, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming.",
  "mn76:5.5": "He is included among the disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing near Kosambī.",
  "mn76:5.6": "Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise quiet.",
  "mn76:5.7": "Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”",
  "mn76:5.8": "Then those wanderers fell silent.",
  "mn76:6.1": "Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the wanderer Sandaka,",
  "mn76:6.2": "who said to him:",
  "mn76:6.3": "“Come, Master Ānanda! Welcome, Master Ānanda!",
  "mn76:6.4": "It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.",
  "mn76:6.5": "Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”",
  "mn76:6.6": "Ānanda sat down on the seat set out,",
  "mn76:6.7": "while Sandaka took a low seat and sat to one side.",
  "mn76:6.8": "Ānanda said to Sandaka:",
  "mn76:6.9": "“Sandaka, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was unfinished?”",
  "mn76:7.1": "“Master Ānanda, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now.",
  "mn76:7.2": "It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later.",
  "mn76:7.3": "It’d be great if Master Ānanda himself would give a Dhamma talk explaining his own teacher’s doctrine.",
  "mn76:7.4": "“Well then, Sandaka, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”",
  "mn76:7.5": "“Yes, sir,” replied Sandaka.",
  "mn76:7.6": "Venerable Ānanda said this:",
  "mn76:7.7": "“Sandaka, these things have been explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha: four ways that negate the spiritual life, and four kinds of unreliable spiritual life. A sensible person would, to the best of their ability, not practice such spiritual paths, and if they did practice it, they wouldn’t succeed in the procedure of the wholesome teaching.”",
  "mn76:7.8": "“But Master Ānanda, what are the four ways that negate the spiritual life, and the four kinds of unreliable spiritual life?”",
  "mn76:8.1": "“Sandaka, take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view:",
  "mn76:8.2": "‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no duties to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.",
  "mn76:8.3": "This person is made up of the four primary elements. When they die, the earth in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of earth. The water in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of water. The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of fire. The air in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of air. The faculties are transferred to space.",
  "mn76:8.4": "Four men with a bier carry away the corpse. Their footprints show the way to the cemetery.",
  "mn76:8.5": "The bones become bleached.",
  "mn76:8.6": "Offerings dedicated to the gods end in ashes.",
  "mn76:8.7": "Giving is a doctrine of morons.",
  "mn76:8.8": "When anyone affirms a positive teaching it’s just baseless, false nonsense.",
  "mn76:8.9": "Both the foolish and the astute are annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and don’t exist after death.’",
  "mn76:9.1": "A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:",
  "mn76:9.2": "‘This teacher has such a doctrine and view.",
  "mn76:9.11": "If what that teacher says is true, both I who have not practiced this and one who has practiced it",
  "mn76:9.12": "have attained exactly the same level. Yet I’m not one who says that both of us are annihilated and destroyed when our body breaks up, and we don’t exist after death.",
  "mn76:9.13": "But it’s superfluous for this teacher to go naked, shaven, persisting in squatting, tearing out their hair and beard. For I’m living at home with my children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, perfumes, and makeup, and accepting gold and money. Yet I’ll have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacher.",
  "mn76:9.14": "What do I know or see that I should live the spiritual live under this teacher?",
  "mn76:9.15": "This negates the spiritual life.’",
  "mn76:9.16": "Realizing this, they get disillusioned and leave.",
  "mn76:9.17": "This is the first way that negates the spiritual life.",
  "mn76:10.1": "Furthermore, take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view:",
  "mn76:10.2": "‘Nothing bad is done by the doer when they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when they encourage others to do the same. Nothing bad is done when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie.",
  "mn76:10.3": "If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razor-edged chakram, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil.",
  "mn76:10.4": "If you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, mutilating, and torturing, and encouraging others to do the same, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil. ",
  "mn76:10.5": "If you were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same, no merit comes of that, and no outcome of merit.",
  "mn76:10.6": "In giving, self-control, restraint, and truthfulness there is no merit or outcome of merit.’",
  "mn76:11.1": "A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:",
  "mn76:11.2": "‘This teacher has such a doctrine and view.",
  "mn76:11.7": "If what that teacher says is true, both I who have not practiced this and one who has practiced it",
  "mn76:11.8": "have attained exactly the same level. Yet I’m not one who says that when both of us act, nothing wrong is done.",
  "mn76:11.9": "But it’s superfluous for this teacher to go naked, shaven, persisting in squatting, tearing out their hair and beard. For I’m living at home with my children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, perfumes, and makeup, and accepting gold and money. Yet I’ll have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacher.",
  "mn76:11.10": "What do I know or see that I should live the spiritual live under this teacher?",
  "mn76:11.11": "This negates the spiritual life.’ Realizing this, they get disillusioned and leave.",
  "mn76:11.12": "This is the second way that negates the spiritual life.",
  "mn76:12.1": "Furthermore, take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view:",
  "mn76:12.2": "‘There’s no cause or condition for the corruption of sentient beings.",
  "mn76:12.3": "Sentient beings are corrupted without cause or condition.",
  "mn76:12.4": "There’s no cause or condition for the purification of sentient beings.",
  "mn76:12.5": "Sentient beings are purified without cause or condition.",
  "mn76:12.6": "There is no power, no energy, no manly strength or vigor.",
  "mn76:12.7": "All sentient beings, all living creatures, all beings, all souls lack control, power, and energy. Molded by their destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirth.’",
  "mn76:13.1": "A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:",
  "mn76:13.2": "‘This teacher has such a doctrine and view.",
  "mn76:13.6": "If what that teacher says is true, both I who have not practiced this and one who has practiced it",

Yet I’ll have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacher.",
  "mn76:13.9": "What do I know or see that I should live the spiritual live under this teacher?",
  "mn76:13.10": "This negates the spiritual life.’",
  "mn76:13.11": "Realizing this, they get disillusioned and leave.",
  "mn76:13.12": "This is the third way that negates the spiritual life.",
  "mn76:14.1": "Furthermore, take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view:",
  "mn76:14.2": "‘There are these seven substances that are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or neutral feeling to each other.",
  "mn76:14.3": "What seven?",
  "mn76:14.4": "The substances of earth, water, fire, air; pleasure, pain, and the soul is the seventh.",
  "mn76:14.5": "These seven substances are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar.",
  "mn76:14.6": "They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. ",
  "mn76:14.7": "They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or neutral feeling to each other. ",
  "mn76:14.8": "And here there is no-one who kills or who makes others kill; no-one who learns or who educates others; no-one who understands or who helps others understand.",
  "mn76:14.9": "If you chop off some’s head with a sharp sword, you don’t take anyone’s life.",
  "mn76:14.10": "The sword simply passes through the gap between the seven substances.",
  "mn76:14.11": "There are 1.4 million main wombs, and 6,000, and 600. There are 500 deeds, and five, and three. There are deeds and half-deeds. There are 62 paths, 62 sub-eons, six classes of rebirth, and eight stages in a person’s life. There are 4,900 <i>Ājīvaka</i> ascetics, 4,900 wanderers, and 4,900 naked ascetics. There are 2,000 faculties, 3,000 hells, and 36 realms of dust. There are seven percipient embryos, seven non-percipient embryos, and seven embryos without attachments. There are seven gods, seven humans, and seven demons. There are seven lakes, seven winds, seven cliffs, and 700 cliffs. There are seven dreams and 700 dreams. There are 8.4 million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of suffering.",
  "mn76:14.12": "And here there is none of this: ‘By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit, or eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by little’—for that cannot be.",
  "mn76:14.13": "Pleasure and pain are allotted. Transmigration lasts only for a limited period, so there’s no increase or decrease, no getting better or worse.",
  "mn76:14.14": "When you toss a ball of string, it rolls away unraveling.",
  "mn76:14.15": "In the same way, after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering.’",
  "mn76:15.1": "A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:",
  "mn76:15.2": "‘This teacher has such a doctrine and view.",

  "mn76:18.3": "He enters an empty house; he gets no alms-food; a dog bites him; he encounters a wild elephant, a wild horse, and a wild cow; he asks the name and clan of a woman or man; he asks the name and path to a village or town.",
  "mn76:18.4": "When asked, ‘Why is this?’ he answers: ‘I had to enter an empty house, that’s why I entered it.",

  "mn76:19.2": "He teaches by oral transmission, by the lineage of testament, by canonical authority.",
  "mn76:19.3": "But when a teacher takes oral transmission to be the truth, some of that is well learned, some poorly learned, some true, and some otherwise.",

  "mn76:32.5": "Suppose there was a person whose hands and feet had been amputated.",
  "mn76:32.6": "Would they be aware that their hands and feet had been amputated constantly and continually, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking?",

  "mn76:33.3": "“It’s incredible, Master Ānanda, it’s amazing!",
  "mn76:33.4": "Namely, that there’s no glorifying one’s own teaching and putting down the teaching of others. The Dhamma is taught in its own field, and so many emancipators are recognized.",
  "mn76:33.5": "But these <i>Ājīvakas</i>, those sons of dead sons, glorify themselves and put others down. And they only recognize three emancipators: ",
  "mn76:33.6": "Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca, and Makkhali Gosāla.”",
  "mn76:33.7": "Then the wanderer Sandaka addressed his own assembly:",
  "mn76:33.8": "“Go, good sirs. The spiritual life is lived under the ascetic Gotama.",
  "mn76:33.9": "It’s not easy for me to give up possessions, honor, or popularity now.”",
  "mn76:33.10": "And that’s how the wanderer Sandaka sent his own assembly to live the spiritual life under the Buddha."
