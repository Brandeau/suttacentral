It was one of the four places of pilgrimage for the Buddhists - the others being Kapilavatthu, Buddhagayā and Kusināra - because it was at, the Migadāya in Isipatana near Bārānasī that the Buddha preached his first sermon to the Pañcavaggiyā (D.ii.141). This was the spot at which all Buddhas set in motion the Wheel of the Law (Dhamma-cakka). It is the custom of Buddhas to travel by air from the Bodhi-tree to the scene of their first sermon, a distance of eighteen leagues (MA.i.388; Bu.A.242, etc.), but the present Buddha did all the journey on foot in order to be able to meet on the way the Ajīvaka Upaka.<br><br>Benares was an important centre of trade and industry. There was direct trade between there and Sāvatthi (DhA.iii.429), the road passing through Bhaddiya (Vin.i.189), and between there and Takkasilā (DhA.i.123). It was the custom for enthusiastic young men of Benares to go to the university at Takkasilā (E.g., J.ii.4; DhA.i.250), but there seem to have been educational institutions at Benares also, some of which were older than even those of Takkasilā (KhA.198; see also DhA.iii.445, where Susīma, Sankha's son, goes from Takkasilā to Benares for purposes of study).<br><br>From Verañjā to Benares there seem to have been two routes: one rather circuitous, passing through Soreyya, and the other direct, crossing the Ganges at Payāgatittha. From Benares the road continued to Vesāli (Sp.i.201). On the road from Benares to Rājagaha was Andhakavinda (Vin.i.220). There seems to have been friendly intercourse between the chieftains of Benares and the kings of Magadha, as shown by the fact that Bimbisāra sent his own physician, Jīvaka, to attend to the son of the Treasurer of Benares (Vin.i.275). The distance from Kosambī to Benares was thirty leagues by river (MA.ii.929).<br><br>The extent of the city of Benares, including its suburbs, at the time when it was the capital of an independent kingdom, is often stated (E.g., J.iv.377; vi.160; MA.ii.608) to have been twelve leagues. The names of several kings are mentioned in the Jātakas, among them being those of Anga, Uggasena, Udaya, Kikī, Dhanañjaya, Mahāsīlava, Vissasena, and Samyama. (The SNA. on the Khaggavisāna Sutta contains the names of several kings of Benares who renounced the world and became Pacceka Buddhas).<br><br>The name which occurs most frequently, however, is that of Brahmadatta, which seems to have been the dynastic name of the Benares kings. In the Mahāgovinda Sutta, the foundation of Bārānasī is attributed to Mahāgovinda, its first king being Dhatarattha, contemporary of Renu (D.ii.235). The Ceylon Chronicles (MT. 127,129,130) mention the names of others who reigned in Benares - e.g., Duppasaha and sixty of his descendants; Asoka, son of Samankara, and eighty four thousand of his descendants; also sixteen kings, ancestors of Okkāka. The city itself had been known by different names at different periods; thus, in the time of the Udaya Jātaka it was called Surundhana; in that of the Sutasoma, Sudassana; in that of the Sonananda, Brahmavaddhana; in that of the Khandahāla, Pupphavatī; in that of the Yuvañjaya, Rammanagara (J.iv.119f); and in that of the Sankha, Molinī (J.iv.15). It was also called Kāsinagara and Kāsipura (E.g., J.v.54; vi.165; DhA.i.87), being the capital of Kāsi. The Bhojājāniya Jātaka (J.i.178) says that \"all the kings around coveted the kingdom of Benares.\" In the Brahāchatta Jātaka (J.iii.116), the king of Benares is mentioned as having captured the whole of Kosala. At the time of the Buddha, however, Benares had lost its great political importance. Kosala was already the paramount power in India, and several successful invasions of Kāsi by the Kosalans under their kings Vanka, Dabbasena and Kamsa, are referred to. The final conquest would seem to be ascribed to Kamsa because the epithet Bārānasīggha (conqueror of Benares) is an established addition to his name (J.ii.403).<br><br>Later, when Ajātasattu succeeded in establishing his sway over Kos<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUEulg1ZCKrtmH3H3Zw5789cvbwKW9HK6g1vb0yymUBlqdB4aaVq-lXqiDy1lkHb-bENKzg3U6SrknKPjyVgv98WyXUH3CwpCSbP_-9Bn80u3KcvMNR6tg\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUFSVCyOMSdXi6jm4u4N5qfSIUOyFNh_zBqZ3bgXkOZ23NuUcScl8VnfBrCKDJGIsxGO84ogMzur6XvwMy33O7fvGwLhOnisIc9Gc01jsn5y\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUFX2YcgpOZIykaaI8zAaqgYsdlQw-89wEMG3bTgPIL5L-X1MHPhQs9kWZzaC-mUf4yLRNPoz2CUM45q17SSQrwHSNBPKvIyOssCcqXnhJ0okOlxgSFyow4sI1PD9fvYFuc\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUEkXbvpEpC4dSSrWIEs02Zy6eSHjaqnWlO3hpGbitSHt_Cmo7XkXhg9MqAGURSV7BYEVLqf8XV2D1FCjGGrDST3rkV-8LVuNPnkfhK_hdb5e2Tke0rvwSY9xwNY6pirXQE4\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />",

              "description": "A city in India on the river of the same name; it was the capital of Aṅga and was celebrated for its beautiful lake, the Gaggarā-pokkharaṇī. On its banks was a grove of campaka-trees, well known for the fragrance of their marvellous white flowers, and there, in the Buddha’s time, wandering teachers were wont to lodge. The Buddha himself stayed thereon several occasions (Vin.i.312; SN.i.195; AN.iv.59; AN.iv.168; AN.v.151; Vin.i.3121). Sāriputta AN.iv.59 and Vaṅgīsa SN.i.195 are also said to have stayed there. The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta DN.ii.147 mentions Campā as one of the six important cities of India, its foundation being ascribed to Mahāgovinda. DN.ii.235 In the Buddha’s time the people of Campā owed allegiance to Bimbisāra, as king of Māgadha, and Bimbisāra had given a royal fief in Campā to the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa. DN.i.111<br><br>The ninth chapter of the Mahā Vagga of the Vinaya Piṭaka Vin.i.312ff. Vin.ii.307 contains several important regulations laid down by the Buddha at Campā regarding the validity and otherwise of formal acts of the Saṅgha.<br><br>The Soṇadaṇḍa, the Dasuttara, the Kandaraka and the Kāraṇḍava Suttas were preached there."

The administration and judicial business of the city and all other matters of importance were discussed and decided in the Santhāgārasālā. DN.i.91 The Buddha and his company lived in the Nigrodhārāma or the Mahāvana. When the Buddha returned a few years after his enlightenment, he met many of his family, and several of them ordained, including Nanda and Rāhula. Vin.i.82Vin.ii.180 <br><br>The Buddha certainly paid other visits besides these to Kapilavatthu. Various Sākyans went to see him both at the Nigrodhārāma and at the Mahāvana, among them being Mahānāma (SN.v.369f; AN.iii.284f; AN.iv.220f; AN.v.320f), Nandiya (SN.v.403f; SN.v.397f; AN.v.334f), Vappa (AN.ii.196; MN.i.91) and perhaps Sārakāni (SN.v.372).<br><br>During one visit the Buddha was entrusted with the consecration of a new mote-hall, built by the Sākyans; he preached far into the night in the new building, and, when weary, asked Moggallāna to carry on while he slept. On this occasion was preached the Sekha Sutta. MN.i.353ff.<br><br>The books record a visit paid by the Brahmā Sahampati to the Buddha in the Mahāvana at Kapilavatthu. The Buddha, worried by the noisy behavior of some monks who had recently been admitted into the Order, was wondering how he could impress on them the nature of their calling. Sahampati visited him and, being thus encouraged, the Buddha returned to Nigrodhārāma and there performed a miracle before the monks; seeing them impressed, he talked to them on the holy life (SN.iii.91f; .Ud.25).<br><br>A curious incident is related in connection with a visit paid by the Buddha to Kapilavatthu, when he went there after his rounds among the Kosalans. Mahānāma was asked to find a place of lodging for the night; he searched all through the town without success, and at length the Buddha was compelled to spend the night in the hermitage of Bharaṇḍu, the Kālāman. AN.i.276f. On another occasion we hear of the Buddha convalescing at Kapilavatthu after an illness. AN.i.219<br><br>Not all the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu believed in their kinsman’s great powers. We find, for instance, Daṇḍapāṇi meeting the Buddha in the Mahāvana and, leaning on his staff, questioning him as to his tenets and his gospel. We are told that in answer to the Buddha’s explanations, Daṇḍapāṇi shook his head, waggled his tongue, and went away, still leaning on his staff, his brow puckered into three wrinkles. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Madhupiṇḍika Sutta. MN.i.108f.<br><br>Others were more convinced and patronised the Order—e.g., Kāla-Khemaka and Ghaṭāya, who built cells for monks in the Nigrodhārāma, as a result of noticing which the Buddha preached the Mahāsuññata Sutta. MN.iii.109<br><br>Mahānāma was the Buddha’s most frequent visitor; to him was preached the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha Sutta. MN.i.91f.<br><br>The Dakkhiṇā-vibhaṅga Sutta was preached as the result of a visit to the Buddha by Mahā-Pajāpatī-Gotamī. Apart from those already mentioned, another Sākyan lady lived in Kapilavatthu, Kāḷigodhā by name, and she was the only kinsman, with the exception of the Buddha’s father and wife, to be specially visited by the Buddha. SN.v.396<br><br>The inhabitants of Kapilavatthu are called Kāpilavatthavā. SN.iv.182<br><br>From Kapilavatthu lay a direct road to Vesālī, Vin.ii.253 and through Kapilavatthu passed the road taken by Bāvarī’s disciples from Alaka to Sāvatthī. Snp.p.194<br><br>It was not mentioned by Ānanda among the great cities, in one of which, in his opinion, the Buddha could more fittingly have died than in Kusinārā. DN.ii.146 After the Buddha’s death, a portion of the relics was claimed by the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu, and a shrine to hold them was erected in the city.

In the time of the Buddha its king was Parantapa, and after him reigned his son Udena. Kosambī was evidently a city of great importance at the time of the Buddha for we find Ānanda mentioning it as one of the places suitable for the Buddha’s Parinibbāna (DN.ii.146; DN.ii.169). It was also the most important halt for traffic coming to Kosala and Māgadha from the south and the west. Vin.i.277<br><br>The usual route from Rājagaha to Kosambī was up the river. This was the route taken by Ānanda when he went with five hundred others to inflict the higher punishment on Channa, Vin.ii.290 though there seems to have been a land route passing through Anupiya and Kosambī to Rājagaha. Vin.ii.184f. In the Sutta Nipāta Snp.1010–1013 the whole route is given from Mahissati to Rājagaha, passing through Kosambī, the halting-places mentioned being Ujjeni, Gonaddha, Vedisa, Vanasavhya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthī, Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, Pāvā, Bhoganagara and Vesāli.<br><br>Near Kosambī, by the river, was Udena’s park, the Udakavana, where Ānanda and Piṇḍola-Bhāradvāja preached to the women of Udena’s palace on two different occasions. Vin.ii.290f. The Buddha is mentioned as having once stayed in the Siṁsapāvana in Kosambī. SN.v.437<br><br>Already in the Buddha’s time there were four establishments of the Order in Kosambī—the Kukkuṭārāma, the Ghositārāma, the Pāvārika-ambavana, and the Badarikārāma. The Buddha visited Kosambī on several occasions, stopping at one or other of these residences, and several discourses delivered during these visits are recorded in the books.<br><br>A great division once arose among the monks in Kosambī. Some monks charged one of their colleagues with having committed an offence, but he refused to acknowledge the charge and, being himself learned in the Vinaya, argued his case and pleaded that the charge be dismissed. The rules were complicated; on the one hand, the monk had broken a rule and was treated as an offender, but on the other, he should not have been so treated if he could not see that he had done wrong. The monk was eventually excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were exchanged. The people of Kosambī, becoming angry at the monks’ behaviour, the quarrel grew apace. The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the monks the story of King Dīghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle their differences without his interference. In disgust the Buddha left Kosambī and, journeying through Bālakaloṇakāragāma and the Pācīnavaṁsadāya, retired alone to keep retreat in the Pārileyyaka forest. In the meantime the monks of both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay followers in Kosambī, and, coming to the Buddha at Sāvatthī, they asked his pardon and settled their dispute. Vin.i.337–357 The story of the Buddha going into the forest is given in the Udāna Ud.iv.5 and in the Saṁyutta, SN.iii.94 but the reason given in these texts is that he found Kosambī uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and heretics.<br><br>During the time of the Vajjian heresy, when the Vajjian monks of Vesāli wished to excommunicate Yasa Kākandakaputta, he went by air to Kosambī, and from there sent messengers to the orthodox monks in the different centres. Vin.ii.298<br><br>It was at Kosambī that the Buddha promulgated a rule forbidding the use of intoxicants by monks. Vin.ii.307<br><br>Kosambī is mentioned in the Saṁyutta Nikāya SN.iv.179 as being on the Ganges, but here as elsewhere this simply means on a great river, in this case the Yamuna.",

At that time it was a small city, “a branch-township with wattle-and-daub houses in the midst of the jungle,” and Ānanda was, at first, disappointed that the Buddha should have chosen it for his Parinibbāna. But the Buddha pointed out to him that in ancient times it had been Kusāvatī, the royal city of Mahā-Sudassana. DN.ii.146ff. It was twelve leagues in length and twelve in breadth, prosperous and full of people, like Āḷakamandā. It was then at the head of eighty-four Towns. SN.iii.144. DN.ii.170f.<br><br>Between Kusinārā and Pāvā lay the stream of Kakuttha on the banks of which was the Ambavana; beyond that was the Hiraññavatī river.<br><br>After the Buddha’s death his body was carried into the city by the northern gate and out of the city by the eastern gate; to the east of the city was Makuṭabandhana, the shrine of the Mallas, and there the body was cremated. For seven days those assembled at the ceremony held a festival in honour of the relics. DN.ii.160f.<br><br>As the scene of his death, Kusinārā became one of the four holy places declared by the Buddha to be fit places of pilgrimage for the pious, the other three being Kapilavatthu, Buddhagayā and Isipatana. DN.ii.140 Mention is made of other visits paid to Kusinārā by the Buddha, prior to that when his death took place. Thus, once he went there from Āpaṇa and having spent some time at Kusinārā, proceeded to Ātumā. The Mallas of Kusinārā were always great admirers of the Buddha, even though not all of them were his followers, and on the occasion of this visit they decided that any inhabitant of Kusinārā who failed to go and meet the Buddha and escort him to the city, would be fined five hundred. It was on this occasion that Rojā the Mallan was converted and gave to the Buddha and the monks a supply of green vegetables and pastries. Vin.i.247f. During some of these visits the Buddha stayed in a wood called Baliharana, and there he preached two of the Kusinārā Suttas (AN.i.274f; AN.v.79f). and the “Kinti” Sutta. MN.ii.238f. A third Kusinārā Sutta he preached while staying at Upavattana. AN.ii.79Ud.iv.2<br><br>The people of Kusinārā are called Kosinārakā.

But Mahā Kaccāna evidently liked it, for he stayed there in the Gundāvana, and was visited there by the king of the city, Avantiputta, MN.ii.83 and the brahmin Kandarāyana. AN.i.67 Already in the Buddha’s time there were, in and around Madhurā, those who accepted his teachings, for the Aṅguttara Nikāya AN.ii.57 mentions that once when he was journeying from Madhurā to Verañja and stopped under a tree by the wayside, a large number of householders, both men and women, came and worshipped him."

It is said MN.iii.68 that these hills, with the exception of Isigili, were once known by other names e.g., Vaṅkaka for Vepulla. SN.ii.191 The Saṁyutta SN.i.206 mentions another peak near Rājagaha—Indakūta.<br><br>Rājagaha was closely associated with the Buddha’s work. He visited it soon after the Renunciation. Bimbisāra saw him begging in the street, and questioned him as to his purpose. Snp.472–491 During the first year after the Enlightenment the Buddha went to Rājagaha from Gayā, after the conversion of the Tebhātika Jatilas. Bimbisāra and his subjects gave the Buddha a great welcome, and the king entertained him and a large following of monks in the palace. It is said that on the day of the Buddha’s entry into the royal quarters, Sakka led the procession, in the guise of a young man, singing songs of praise of the Buddha. Vin.i.35ff. Large numbers of householders joined the Order, and people blamed the Buddha for breaking up their families. But their censure lasted for only seven days. Among those ordained were the Sattarasavaggiyā with Upāli at their head.<br><br>The Buddha spent his first vassa in Rājagaha and remained there during the winter and the following summer. The people grew tired of seeing the monks everywhere, and, on coming to know of their displeasure, the Buddha went first to Dakkhiṇāgiri and then to Kapilavatthu. Vin.i.77ff.<br><br>Later the Buddha made Sāvatthī his headquarters, though he seems frequently to have visited and stayed at Rājagaha. It thus became the scene of several important suttas—e.g., the Āṭānāṭiya, Udumbarika and Kassapasīhanāda, Jīvaka, Mahāsakuladāyī, and Sakkapañha.<br><br>Many of the Vinaya rules were enacted at Rājagaha. Just before his death, the Buddha paid a last visit there. At that time, Ajātasattu was contemplating an attack on the Vajjians, and sent his minister, Vassakāra, to the Buddha at Gijjhakūṭa, to find out what his chances of success were. DN.ii.72<br><br>After the Buddha’s death, Rājagaha was chosen by the monks, with Mahā Kassapa at their head, as the meeting place of the First Convocation. This took place at the Sattapaṇṇiguhā, and Ajātasattu extended to the undertaking his whole hearted patronage. Vin.ii.285 The king also erected at Rājagaha a cairn over the relics of the Buddha, which he had obtained as his share. DN.ii.166<br><br>Rājagaha was one of the six chief cities of the Buddha’s time, and as such, various important trade routes passed through it. The others cities were Campā, Sāvatthī, Sāketa, Kosambī and Benares. DN.ii.147<br><br>The Parāyana Vagga Snp.1011–1013 mentions a long and circuitous route, taken by Bāvarī’s disciples in going from Patiṭṭhāna to Rājagaha, passing through Māhissati, Ujjeni, Gonaddha, Vedisa. Vanasavhaya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthī, Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, on to Rājagaha, by way of the usual places. The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta DN.ii.72ff. gives a list of the places at which the Buddha stopped during his last journey along that road—Ambalaṭṭhikā, Nāḷandā, Pāṭaligāma, Koṭigāma, Nādikā, Vesāli, Bhaṇḍagāma, Hatthigāma, Ambagāma, Jambugāma, Bhoganagara, Pāvā, and the Kakuttha River, beyond which lay the Mango grove and the Sāla grove of the Mallas.<br><br>The books mention various places besides Veḷuvana, with its Kalandaka-nivāpa vihāra in and around Rājagaha—e.g., Sītavana, Jīvaka’s Ambavana, Pipphaliguhā, Udumbarikārāma, Moranivāpa with its Paribbājakārāma, Tapodārāma, Indasālaguhā in Vediyagiri, Sattapaṇṇiguhā, Latthivana, Maddakucchi, Supatiṭṭhacetiya, Pāsānakacetiya, Sappasoṇḍikapabbhāra and the pond Sumāgadhā.<br><br>The city gates were closed every evening, and after that it was impossible to enter the city.

It is not possible to know how many visits were paid by the Buddha to Vesāli, but the books would lead us to infer that they were several. Various Vinaya rules are mentioned as having been laid down at Vesāli (Vin.i.238; Vin.i.287f; Vin.ii.118; Vin.ii.119–127).<br><br>It was during a stay in Vesāli, whither he had gone from Kapilavatthu, that Mahā Pajāpatī Gotamī followed the Buddha with five hundred other Sākyan women, and, with the help of Ānanda’s intervention, obtained permission for women to enter the Order. Vin.ii.253ff.<br><br>The books describe DN.ii.95ff. at some length the Buddha’s last visit to Vesāli on his way to Kusinārā. On the last day of this visit, after his meal, he went with Ānanda to Cāpāla cetiya for his siesta, and, in the course of their conversation, he spoke to Ānanda of the beauties of Vesāli: of the Udena cetiya, the Gotamaka cetiya, the Sattambaka cetiya, the Bahuputta cetiya, and the Sārandada cetiya. Other monasteries are also mentioned, in or near Vesāli e.g., Pātikārāma, Vālikārāma.<br><br>The Buddha generally stayed at the Kūṭāgārasālā during his visits to Vesāli, but it appears that he sometimes lived at these different shrines. DN.ii.118 During his last visit to the Cāpāla cetiya he decided to die within three months, and informed Māra and, later, Ānanda, of his decision. The next day he left Vesāli for Bhaṇḍagāma, after taking one last look at the city, “turning his whole body round, like an elephant”. DN.ii.122 The rainy season which preceded this, the Buddha spent at Beluvagāma, a suburb of Vesāli, while the monks stayed in and around Vesāli. On the day before he entered into the vassa, Ambapāli invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal, at the conclusion of which she gave her Ambavana for the use of the Order. DN.ii.98<br><br>Among eminent followers of the Buddha who lived in Vesāli, special mention is made of Ugga, Piṅgiyāni, Kāraṇapālī, Sīha, Vāseṭṭha, AN.iv.258 and the various Licchavis.<br><br>Vesāli was a stronghold of the Nigaṇṭhas. The Buddha’s presence in Vesāli was a source of discomfort to the Nigaṇṭhas, and we find mention of various devices resorted to by them to prevent their followers from coming under the influence of the Buddha.<br><br>At the time of the Buddha, Vesāli was a very large city, rich and prosperous, crowded with people and with abundant food. Its courtesan, Ambapālī, was famous for her beauty, and helped in large measure in making the city prosperous. Vin.i.268<br><br>Outside the town was the Mahāvana, a large, natural forest. Near by were other forests, such as Gosiṅgalasāla. AN.v.134<br><br>Among important suttas preached at Vesāli are the Mahāli, Mahāsīhanāda, Cūḷa Saccaka, Mahā Saccaka, Tevijja, Vacchagotta, Sunakkhatta and Ratana.<br><br>One hundred years after the Buddha’s death Vesāli was again the scene of interest for Buddhists, on account of the “Ten Points” raised by the Vajjiputtaka, and the second Council held in connection with this dispute at the Vālikārāma.<br><br>There were Nāgas living in Vesāli; these were called Vesālā.

When the Buddha was on tour near there he was repeatedly warned by the cowherds not to go to Ambatiṭṭha as in the Jaṭila’s hermitage in the village dwelt a mighty Nāga. While the Buddha was yet in Bhaddavatikā the Elder Sāgata went to the Jaṭila’s hermitage and took up his abode near the fireplace. The Nāga showed his resentment, but Sāgata was able to overcome him by means of his iddhi-powers. Later Sāgata visited the Buddha at Bhaddavatikā and went with him to Kosambī. The fame of the Elder’s victory over the Nāga had preceded him and the inhabitants of Kosambī were lavish in their hospitality to him. He drank wine in their houses and had to be carried to see the Buddha. The latter made this the occasion for declaring the drinking of intoxicants to be a pācittiya-offence. Vin.iv.108–110"

At that time there dwelt in it a monk who had been ordained late in life and had formerly been a barber. He had two sons, handsome, elegant and well versed in the barber’s art. When the monk heard of the Buddha’s coming, he sent his sons from house to house to collect salt and oil and rice and meal. The young men, using all their powers of persuasion, collected a large quantity of each of these things, and when the Buddha arrived in Ātumā and went to stay in the Bhūsāgāra, they made ready rice-gruel and offered it to him. The Buddha, however, would not accept it as the monk, who had had the food collected, had been guilty of an unlawful act in that one monk had begged for others.<br><br>It was on this occasion that it was declared to be a dukkaṭa offence for a monk, who had formerly been a barber, to carry about with him a barber’s equipment. Vin.i.249–250<br><br>In the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta DN.ii.131–13​2 the Buddha tells Pukkusa of another occasion on which he was staying in the Bhūsāgāra in Ātumā. There was a thunderstorm and two peasants and four oxen were struck by lightning. A large number of people having gathered at the place, one of them asked the Buddha if he were aware of the accident. But the Buddha had been in a state of concentration and had neither seen nor heard anything of it. Such was the state of calm of his mind."

Their interview with the Buddha is recorded in the Vāseṭṭha Sutta (Snp.p.115ff; MN.ii.146ff). <br><br>According to the Saṁyutta Nikāya, SN.v.325 the Buddha once stayed for three months in the jungle thicket at Icchānaṅgala, in almost complete solitude, visited only by a single monk who brought him his food. But from the Aṅguttara Nikāya (AN.iii.30f; AN.iii.341; AN.iv.340ff) it would appear that the Buddha was not left to enjoy the solitude which he desired, for we are told that the residents of Icchānaṅgala, having heard of the Buddha’s visit, came to him in large numbers and created a disturbance by their shouts. The Buddha had to send Nāgita, who was then his personal attendant, to curb the enthusiasm of his admirers."

Although it later became the capital of Magadha, it was then a mere village. At that time Ajātasattu's ministers, Sunīdha and Vassakāra, were engaged in building fortifications there in order to repel the Vajjīs. The Buddha prophesied the future greatness of Pātaligāma, and also mentioned the danger of its destruction by fire, water, or internal discord. The gate by which the Buddha left the town was called Gotamadvāra, and the ferry at which he crossed the river, Gotamatittha (Vin.i.226 30; D.ii.86ff).<br><br>The date at which Pātaliputtta became the capital is uncertain. Hiouen Thsang seems to record (Beal: Records ii.85, n. 11) that it was Kālāsoka who moved the seat of government there. The Jains maintain that it was Udāyi, son of Ajātasattu (Vin. Texts ii.102, n. 1). The latter tradition is probably correct as, according to the Anguttara Nikāya (iii.57) even Munda is mentioned as residing at Pātaliputta. It was, however, in the time of Asoka that the city enjoyed its greatest glory. In the ninth year of his reign Asoka's income from the four gates of the city is said to have been four hundred thousand kahāpanas daily, with another one hundred thousand for his sabhā or Council (Sp.i.52).<br><br>The city was known to the Greeks as Pālibothra, and Megasthenes, who spent some time there, has left a vivid description of it (Buddhist India 262f). It continued to be the capital during the greater part of the Gupta dynasty, from the fourth to the sixth century A.C. Near Pātaliputta was the Kukkutārāma, where monks (e.g. Ananda, Bhadda and Nārada) stayed when they came to Pātaliputta (M.i.349; A.v.341; A.iii.57; S.v.15f; 171f). At the suggestion of Udena Thera, the brahmin Ghotamukha built an assembly hall for the monks in the city (M.ii.163).<br><br>Pātaligāma was so called because on the day of its foundation several pātali shoots sprouted forth from the ground. The officers of Ajātasattu and of the Licchavi princes would come from time to time to Pātaligāma, drive the people from their houses, and occupy them themselves. A large hall was therefore built in the middle of the village, divided into various apartments for the housing of the officers and their retainers when necessary. The Buddha arrived in the village on the day of the completion of the building, and the villagers invited him to occupy it for a night, that it might be blessed by his presence. On the next day they entertained the Buddha and his monks to a meal (Ud.viii.6; UdA.407ff).",

              "description": "A town in Kosala. It was regarded in the Buddha’s time as one of the six great cities of India, the others being Campā, Rājagaha, Sāvatthī, Kosambī and Benares. DN.ii.146 In the Vinaya Vin.i.253 however, the distance between āvatthī and Sāketa is given as six leagues. The town lay on the direct route between Sāvatthī and Patiṭṭhāna, and is mentioned Snp.1011–1013 as the first stopping place out of Sāvatthī. The distance between the two places could be covered in one day, with seven relays of horses, MN.i.149 but the books contain several references (Vin.i.88; Vin.i.89; Vin.i.270; Vin.iii.212; Vin.iv.63; Vin.iv.120) to the dangers of the journey when undertaken on foot. The road was infested with robbers, and the king had to maintain soldiers to protect travellers.<br><br>Midway between Sāketa and Sāvatthī was Toraṇavatthu, and it is said SN.iv.374ff. that, when Pasenadi went from the capital to Sāketa, he spent a night in Toraṇavatthu, where be visited Khemā Therī who lived there. Between Sāketa and Sāvatthī was a broad river which could be crossed only by boat (Vin.iv.65; Vin.iv.228). Near Sāketa was the Añjanavana, where the Buddha sometimes stayed during his visits to Sāketa and where he had several discussions e.g., with Kakudha, SN.i.54 Mendasira, and Kuṇḍaliya. SN.v.73<br><br>On other occasions he stayed at the Kāḷakārāma AN.ii.24 gifted to the Order by Kāḷaka, and the Tikantakivana, AN.iii.169 both of which were evidently near the city. Mention is also made (SN.v.174; SN.v.298f; Vin.i.289) of Sāriputta, Moggallāna and Anuruddha staying together in Sāketa. Bhaddākāpilāni Vin.iv.292 also stayed there, so did Ānanda. Once when Ānanda was staying in the Migadāya in the Añjanavana, a nun, described as Jatilagāhikā, visited him and questioned him regarding concentration. AN.iv.427 Among others who lived in Sāketa were Jambugāmikaputta, Gavampati, Mendasira, Uttara, Madhuvāsettha and his son Mahānāga, and Visākhā. Bhūta Thera was born in a suburb of Sāketa.<br><br>The Vinaya Vin.i.270f. mentions another seṭṭhi of Sāketa. His wife had suffered for seven years from a disease of the head, and even skilled physicians failed to cure her. Jīvaka, on his way to Rājagaha, after finishing his studies in Takkasilā, visited Sāketa, heard of her illness, and offered to cure her. At first the seṭṭhi was sceptic, but in the end allowed Jīvaka to attend on his wife. Jīvaka cured her by the administration of ghee through the nose, and, as reward, received sixteen thousand kahāpanas from her and her various kinsmen."

MN.i.166 The place chosen by the Bodhisatta for his penances was called Senānigama.<br><br>From Uruvelā the Buddha went to Isipatana, but after, he had made sixty-one arahants and sent them out on tour to preach the Doctrine, he returned to Uruvelā, to the Kappāsikavanasanda and converted the Bhaddavaggiyā. Vin.i.23f. At Uruvelā dwelt also the Tebhātika-Jatilas: Uruvelā-Kassapa, Nadī-Kassapa and Gayā-Kassapa, who all became followers of the Buddha. Vin.i.25<br><br>Mention is made of several temptations of the Buddha while he dwelt at Uruvelā, apart from the supreme contest with Māra, under the Bodhi-tree. Once Māra came to him in the darkness of the night in the guise of a terrifying elephant, trying to frighten him. On another dark night when the rain was falling drop by drop, Māra came to the Buddha and assumed various wondrous shapes, beautiful and ugly. Another time Māra tried to fill the Buddha’s mind with doubt as to whether he had really broken away from all fetters and won complete Enlightenment. SN.i.103ff. Seven years after the Buddha’s Renunciation, Māra made one more attempt to make the Buddha discontented with his lonely lot and it was then, when Māra had gone away discomfited, that Māra’s three daughters, Taṇhā, Ratī and Ragā, made a final effort to draw the Buddha away from his purpose. SN.i.124f.<br><br>It was at Uruvelā, too, that the Buddha had misgivings in his own mind as to the usefulness of preaching the Doctrine which he had realised, to a world blinded by passions and prejudices. The Brahmā Sahampati thereupon entreated the Buddha not to give way to such diffidence (SN.i.136ff; Vin.i.4f). It is recorded that either on this very occasion or quite soon after, the thought arose in the Buddha’s mind that the sole method of winning Nibbāna was to cultivate the four satipaṭṭhānas and that Sahampati visited the Blessed One and confirmed his view (SN.v.167; SN.v.185). A different version occurs elsewhere, SN.v.232 where the thought which arose in the Buddha’s mind referred to the five controlling faculties, and Brahmā tells the Buddha that in the time of Kassapa he had been a monk named Sahaka and that then he had practised these five faculties.<br><br><br><br>https://www.youtube.com/embed/qYOUSCDNFvI<br><br><br><br>https://www.youtube.com/embed/qYOUSCDNFvI<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYOUSCDNFvI\"><img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/qYOUSCDNFvI/hqdefault.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /></a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qYOUSCDNFvI\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/qYOUSCDNFvI</a><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUHexsH3zAG4NIT5udi0tBPw6gouKD2kDZXXjGWEjxmBVURfIu816v91Mhk6Kp_mJUL6AZeYEa3odUjY0iFL8LIPKoonki8_DwuF_WjngeLLIUB6g3WrtmK_QenAZgO0\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />",

Verañja visits the Buddha at the foot of the Naḷerupucimanda, where he is staying, and asks him a series of questions, the first of which is: whether it be true that the Buddha pays no respect to aged brahmins. The Buddha replies that he has not seen a brahmin in the whole world to whom such respect is due from him. If the Tathāgata were so to honour anyone, that person’s head would split in pieces. Other questions follow on the Buddha’s doctrine and practices. The Buddha concludes by giving an account of his attainment of the threefold knowledge. The interview ends with the conversion of Verañja and his invitation to the Buddha to spend his rainy season there.<br><br>At that time there was a famine, and five hundred householders of Uttarāpatha, staying at Verañjā, supplied the monks with food. Moggallāna proposed to get food by the exercise of his magic power or by going with the monks to Uttarakuru, but he was dissuaded by the Buddha. During this stay Sāriputta received from the Buddha an explanation as to why the religious systems of the three previous Buddhas lasted so long, while those of the three preceding them—​​Vipassī, Sikhī and Vesabhū—​​did not.<br><br>At the conclusion of the vassa, the Buddha wished to take leave of Verañja before setting out, as was the custom of Buddhas when they received hospitality. Verañja admitted that, though he had invited the Buddha, he had not kept his promise, and this was due to his having too many duties in the house.<br><br>He invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal the next day, and, at the end of the meal, presented a set of three robes to the Buddha and a pair to each of the monks.<br><br>After leaving Verañjā the Buddha went to Benares, passing through Soreyya, Saṅkassa and Kaṇṇakujja, and crossing the Ganges at Payāgapatiṭṭhāna. From Benares he proceeded to Vesāli. This account, of the Buddha’s visit to Verañjā, forms the introduction to the Vinaya. Vin.iii.1–11 The interview with Verañja is given in the Aṅguttara. AN.iv.172ff.<br><br>A road led from Verañjā to Madhurā, and the Aṅguttara Nikāya AN.ii.57f. contains a sermon preached by the Buddha to a large number of people while he rested by the roadside. There was evidently frequent intercourse between Sāvatthī and Verañjā, and the Verañjaka Sutta was preached to some brahmins who visited the Buddha at Sāvatthī, whither they had gone on business. The books also record AN.iv.198f. a visit paid by the Asura Pahārāda to the Buddha at Verañjā."

On all these occasions Brahma Sahampati appeared to him and confirmed his thoughts. Several old brahmins, advanced in years, visited the Buddha during this period and questioned him as to whether it were true that he did not pay respect to age.

It was evidently a favourite resort of those who followed the religious life.<br><br>The Buddha seems to have been attracted by its solitude, and is mentioned as having visited it on several occasions, sometimes even in the dark, in drizzling rain, while Māra made unsuccessful attempts to frighten him. SN.i.109<br><br>It was on the slopes of Gijjhakūṭa, where the Buddha was wandering about, that Devadatta hurled at him a mighty stone to kill him, but only a splinter injured his foot. Vin.ii.193<br><br>Among those who visited the Buddha on Gijjhakūṭa are mentioned: Sahampati, SN.i.153 the youth Māgha, Snp.p.86 the Yakkha Inda, SN.i.206 Sakka (SN.i.233; SN.iv.102), the Paribbājaka Sajjha, AN.iv.371 the Kassapagotta monk, AN.i.237 Pañcasikha (SN.iv.103; DN.ii.220), Sutavā, AN.iv.369 the four kings of the Cātummahārājika world and their followers, DN.iii.195 Abhayarājakumāra, SN.v.126 Upaka Maṇḍikāputta, AN.ii.181 Dhammika,, AN.iii.368 and Vassakāra (AN.iv.18; DN.ii.72).<br><br>Several well-known suttas were preached on Gijjhakūṭa—e.g., the Māgha, Dhammika and Chaḷabhijāti Suttas, the discourse on the seven Aparihānīyadhammā, AN.iv.21f. the Mahāsāropama and Āṭānāṭiya Suttas (SN.ii.155; SN.ii.185; SN.ii.190; SN.ii.241; SN.iii.121; AN.ii.73; AN.iii.21; AN.iv.160).<br><br>Monks arriving late at Rājagaha would ask Dabbamallaputta-Tissa to find accommodation for them in Gijjhakūṭa, in order to test his capabilities. Vin.ii.76<br><br>Mention is made of several eminent monks who stayed at Gijjhakūṭa from time to time, such as Sāriputta, MN.iii.263AN.iii.300SN.ii.155 Ānanda, AN.iii.383 Mahā Kassapa, Anuruddha, Puṇṇa Mantāniputta, Upāli and Devadatta, SN.ii.155 Cunda, and Channa. SN.iv.55<br><br>Channa fell ill there, and ultimately committed suicide. Another monk is mentioned as having thrown himself down from Gijjhakūṭa because he was discontented with his life. Vin.iii.82<br><br> Moggallāna and Lakkhaṇa are reported to have stayed there, and to have seen many inhabitants of Rājagaha reborn in Gijjhakūṭa as petas. SN.ii.254Vin.iii.104AN.iv.75<br><br>The Mettiya-bhummajakas Vin.iii.167 and the Chabbaggiyas Vin.iii.82 were also in the habit of visiting the hill.<br><br>Several places are mentioned as having been visited by the Buddha during his sojourns on Gijjhakūṭa, and it may be inferred from accounts given of these visits that these places were within easy reach of the hill. Such, for example, are: the Paṭibhānakūṭa, SN.v.448 the Sītavana, where the Buddha went to visit Soṇa, AN.iii.374 the river Sappinī, on the banks of which lived various Paribbājakas, including Sarabha (AN.i.185; AN.ii.29; AN.ii.176), and the Paribbājakārāma of Udumbarika the residence of Nigrodha, near the Moranivāpa on the bank of the lake Sumāgadhā. DN.iii.39<br><br>The Sūkara-khatalena was on the slope of Gijjhakūṭa, and there the Buddha was once visited by Dīghanakha (SN.v.233; MN.i.497).<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUFqZIZ6OJAP3wNqTFJU8yXWozwmyXfMYlivKNxPu0BkeF9tKABZuqjUxK80i5tMmpzZD86rtTbCmbh-9pdqaYaHHFi82pU6cryaEoPswrPRdQh0eE-ODDVIAZaraa4CogMXIXuSob5FAd5Ps8JbUfa1T_af7CIBzxCsVSbyLM9VzoMFmq484qbct-lVyjLYpwdPTDICp_rrSHlfoY1ALoEB3gVk4EAaZzjEb2CHZJb4_4-PHKhdzjINg9e2cLeY6RUdK3EGMmXyf9HSpNYRFh9Q-L6hxVPkX7IKaslYblSU8ReybfLmWjozppRKvQJCbJuM2NUoEbU0Cz6wL1cgIA\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUE4guKVzDPBRn4j58Wp2n-8l7J9JHRskmeO2DSL78jZqv8HAjbUFbFYZwHHijliXu_NwyKVvrVlQqynmPBKyCRN9DdmNJs3LJgp4ngDZDkIWdSak8H0bQ\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUHZFmnnJMX2ZqKCEjUxyRT2nBOTODYjkjHAVW96teqVVCduUbm3K9fJtro0MU1qPnkxtv05BGUOiMkKQVnAcGe9orZME30Ki51gGdDoJ5xm\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUHo2kHo9LOdykRd2hWTDGuOa-J3oD8xqsjYpvFCzQjlWCcp7om6JyXBNPkwfcpYie6edSlPMYfkkJclqX1zGkRYL13RulkV8wyQVg1cc5O4-w\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />",

Does this perhaps mean that the people of Nādikā were more interested in this problem than the people of other places? It was by way of finding a permanent solution to these questions that the Buddha preached to Ānanda at Giñjakāvasatha the “Mirror of Truth” on his last visit to Nādikā, as described in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta (DN.ii.91ff; SN.v.357).<br><br>The “Brick Hall” was, however, not designed for the Buddha and his monks alone, for we find mention of members of other sects staying there, e.g., the Paribbājaka Sabhiya Kaccāna.

The Buddha questioned them as to their practises and preached to them the above-mentioned Sutta, which he afterwards repeated to Mahānāma. MN.i.91ff.<br><br>Once when the Buddha was dwelling at Kāḷasilā, he sang the praises of Rājagaha, giving Ānanda a chance, if he so desired, of asking him to live on for a kappa; but Ānanda did not take his opportunity. DN.iii.116<br><br>The books refer to several other visits of the Buddha to Isigilapassa. During one of these visits he heard Vaṅgīsa’s high eulogy of Moggallāna (SN.i.194; Thag.1249ff).<br><br>In the Isigili Sutta MN.iii.68–71 the Buddha is represented as saying that while the other mountains round Rājagaha—Vebhāra, Paṇḍava, Vepulla and Gijjhakūṭa—had changed their old names, Isigili retained its former name and designation.<br><br>Five hundred Pacceka Buddhas once resided in Isigili for a long time; they could be seen entering the mountain, but once entered, there was no more sign of them. Men, observing this, said that the mountain swallowed up the sages and so it came by its name of Isigili (“Gullet of the Sages“)."

It was eighteen leagues from Uruvelā, and when Gotama gave up his austere penances his friends, the Pañcavaggiyā monks, left him and went to Isipatana. After his Enlightenment the Buddha, leaving Uruvelā, joined them in Isipatana, and it was there that he preached his first sermon, the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta. Vin.i.10f.<br><br>Isipatana is mentioned by the Buddha as one of the four places of pilgrimage which his devout followers should visit. DN.ii.141<br><br>Here it was that one day at dawn Yasa came to the Buddha and became an arahant. Vin.i.15f. It was at Isipatana, too, that the rule was passed prohibiting the use of sandals made of talipot leaves. Vin.i.189 On another occasion when the Buddha was staying at Isipatana, having gone there from Rājagaha, he instituted rules forbidding the use of certain kinds of flesh, including human flesh. Vin.i.216ff. Twice, while the Buddha was at Isipatana, Māra visited him but had to go away discomfited.

The Buddha stayed there on several occasions, and in the books are found records of various eminent persons who visited him there and of his conversations with them. Among such visitors are mentioned several Licchavi chiefs, Mahāli Otthatthaddha (DN.i.150ff;SN.i.230f;SN.iii.68f;AN.v.86f), Nandaka, SN.v.389 Sunakkhatta, MN.ii.252 Bhaddiya, AN.ii.190f. Sāḷha and Abhaya, AN.ii.200 all attended by numerous retinues; their senāpati, Sīha, who went with five hundred chariots, having only decided after much hesitation to see the Buddha; (AN.iii.38f;AN.iv.79;AN.iv.179ff) the Jaina Saccaka, whom the Buddha won only after much argumentation, as described in the Cūḷa- and the Mahā-Saccaka Suttas (MN.i.227ff;MN.i.237ff), the householder Ugga of Vesāli, acclaimed by the Buddha for the possession of eight eminent qualities (AN.iii.49;AN.iv.208f; SN.iv.109) the upāsaka Vāseṭṭha; AN.iv.258f. the two goddesses, daughters of Pajjunna, both known as Kokanadā; SN.i.29f and the brahmin Piṅgiyāni AN.iii.237f.<br>The Licchavis waited on the Buddha and ministered to him during his stay in the Kūṭāgārasālā, and it is said that they were of various hues: some blue, others yellow, etc. And Piṅgiyānī, seeing the Buddha shining in their midst, surpassing them all, once uttered the Buddha’s praises in verse, winning, as reward from the Licchavis, five hundred upper garments, all of which, be, in turn, presented to the Buddha AN.iii.239f. On one occasion, when the Buddha was preaching to the monks regarding the six spheres of sense contact, Māra arranged an earthquake to break the monks’ concentration, but failed to achieve his object. SN.i.112 It was here that the Buddha finally agreed to grant the request of the five hundred Sākyan women, led by Pajāpatī Gotamī, that they might be ordained as nuns. They had followed the Buddha hither from Kapilavatthu (AN.iv.274f; Vin.ii.253f). The Buddha gave Pajāpatī Gotamī, at her special request, a summary of his doctrine. AN.iv.280 It was also at the Kūṭāgārasālā that the Buddha uttered his prophecy as to the ultimate downfall of-the Licchavis. SN.ii.267f.<br>It was customary for the Buddha, when staying at the Kūṭāgārasālā, to spend the noonday siesta in the woods outside the Mahāvana, at the foot of a tree; visitors coming at that time would, if their desire to see him was insistent (DN.i.151;AN.iii.75) seek him there or be conducted to him. Sometimes he would express his desire to see no one during such a retreat, except the monk who brought him his food.<br>On one occasion the retreat lasted a fortnight, and on his return he found that a large number of monks had committed suicide as a result of a sermon he had preached to them before his retreat on the un-loveliness of the body. He then caused the monks to be assembled, and asked them to concentrate on breathing SN.v.320f. Sometimes the Buddha would walk from the Kūṭāgārasālā to places of interest in the neighbourhood—e.g., the Sārandada-cetiya AN.iii.167 and the Cāpāla-cetiya (SN.v.258;AN.iv.308f) It was from the Cāpāla-cetiya, during one of these walks that he gazed for the last time on Vesāli. He then returned to the Kūṭāgārasālā, where he announced that his death would take place within three months (DN.ii.119f;SN.v.258ff)<br>There was a sick ward attached to the monastery, where the Buddha would often visit the patients and talk with them. (SN.iv.210f;AN.iii.142)<br>The books also contain the names of others who stayed at the Kūṭāgārasālā when the Buddha was in residence—e.g., Ānanda, who was visited there by the Licchavis Abhaya and Panditakumāra;. AN.i.220 Anuruddha, who lived there in a forest hut; (SN.iii.116;SN.iv.380) Nāgita, the Buddha’s former attendant, and Nāgita’s nephew the novice Sīha; DN.i.151 also Cāla, Upacāla, Kakkaṭa, Kaḷimbha, Nikata, and Kaṭissaha, all of whom left the Kūṭāgārasālā and retired to the Gosiṅgasālavana, when the visits of the Licchavis to the Buddha became disturbing to their solitude. AN.v.133f."

When Devadatta, wishing to kill the Buddha, hurled a rock down Gijjhakūṭa, it was stopped midway by another rock, but a splinter from it fell on the Buddha’s foot, wounding it severely. As the Buddha suffered much from loss of blood, the monks took him on a litter to Maddakucchi, and from there to the Jīvakambavana, where he was treated by Jīvaka. Vin.ii.193f. It is said SN.i.27f. that seven hundred devas of the Satullapa group visited the Buddha there and told him of their great admiration for his qualities. Māra tried to stir up discontent in the Buddha, but had to retire discomfited (SN.i.110; DN.ii.116).<br><br>Once when Mahā Kappina was at Maddakucchi, doubts arose in his mind as to the necessity of joining the assembly of monks for the holding of uposatha, he himself being pure. The Buddha read his thoughts, appeared before him, and urged upon him the necessity of so doing. Vin.i.105<br><br>Maddakucchi was difficult of access; monks who came from afar late at night, wishing to put Dabba Mallaputta’s powers to the test, would often ask him to provide lodging there for them (Vin.ii.76; Vin.iii.159)."

It is said that, one day, when Visākhā had gone to the monastery to hear the Dhamma and afterwards attend on the sick monks and novices, she left in the preaching hall her jewellery and her servant girl forgot to remove it. Later, on going to fetch it, she found that Ānanda had put it away, and Visākhā, being told of this, decided not to wear it again. She had it valued by goldsmiths, who declared that it was worth nine crores and one hundred thousand. She had the ornament put in a cart and sent round for sāle. But there was none in Sāvatthī rich enough to buy it, and Visākhā herself bought it back. With the money thus obtained she built the Migāramātupāsāda at the Buddha’s suggestion. Vin.iv.161f.

This was refused, and from there the Buddha went on to Vesāli (Vin.ii.253; AN.iv.274). The Buddha stayed at the Nigrodhārāma on several other occasions, and several Vinaya rules are mentioned as being first promulgated there (Vin.iii.235; Vin.iii.244; Vin.iv.55; Vin.iv.101; Vin.iv.167; Vin.iv.181; Vin.iv.262; Vin.iv.314). Various Sākyans came to see the Buddha at the Nigrodhārāma, among them, Mahānāma, Godha, Sarakāni, Nandiya and Vappa (SN.v.369–378; SN.v.395–397; SN.v.403–404; SN.v.408; AN.ii.196; AN.iii.284; AN.iv.220; AN.v.83; AN.v.328; AN.v.332; AN.v.334). The Buddha himself visited Kāḷigodhā during his residence there. It was during a discussion with Mahānāma that the Cūḷa Dukkhakkhandha Sutta was preached. During one of the Buddha’s residences in Nigrodhārāma, the Sākyans invited him to consecrate their new Mote Hall, which he did by preaching there far into the night and then asking Moggallāna to continue his discourse (SN.iv.182ff; MN.i.353). On another occasion the Buddha is mentioned as having spent a period of convalescence at Nigrodhārāma. AN.i.219f. It seems to have been the Buddha’s custom, when staying at Nigrodhārāma, sometimes to spend the noonday siesta in the Mahāvana near by. SN.iii.91f.<br><br>Among others mentioned as having stayed at Nigrodhārāma is Lomasakaṅgiya. MN.iii.200 A deva called Candana there taught him the Bhaddekaratta Sutta. Is this Lomasakaṅgiya the same as Lomavaṅgīsa, who is also mentioned SN.v.327 as having lived in Nigrodhārāma?"

The countries mentioned are Aṅga, Māgadha, Kāsī, Kosala, Vajji, Mallā, Ceti, Vaṁsa, Kuru, Pañcāla, Macchā, Sūrasena, Assaka, Avantī, Gandhāra, and Kamboja (AN.i.213; AN.iv.252; AN.iv.256; AN.iv.260; DN.ii.200).<br><br>It was to the east of Māgadha, from which it was separated by the River Campā, and had as its capital city Campā. Another city mentioned is Assapūra. MN.i.271<br><br>In the Buddha’s time the Aṅgarājā was just a wealthy nobleman, and he is mentioned merely as having granted a pension to a Brahmin. MN.ii.163 The people of Aṅga and Māgadha are generally mentioned together, so we may gather that by the Buddha’s time they had become one people. They provide Uruvelā-Kassapa with offerings for his great sacrifice. Vin.i.27<br><br>Several discourses were preached in the Aṅga country, among them being the Soṇadaṇḍa Sutta and the two Assapura Suttas. The Mahāgovinda Sutta seems to indicate that once, in the past, Dhataraṭṭha was king of Aṅga. But this, perhaps, refers to another country.<br><br>Soṇa Koḷivisa, before he entered the Order, was a squire (paddhagu) of Aṅga. Thag.632",

              "description": "One of the four great monarchies in the time of the Buddha, the other three being Māgadha, Kosala and Vaṁsa (or Vatsa). Avanti is also mentioned among the sixteen Great Nations (AN.i.213; AN.iv.252; AN.iv.256; AN.iv.260).<br><br>Its capital was Ujjenī. But according to another account, DN.ii.235 Māhissati is mentioned as having been, at least for some time, the capital of Avanti. It is quite likely that ancient Avanti was divided into two parts, the northern part having its capital at Ujjenī and the southern part (also called Avanti Dakkhiṇāpatha) at Māhissati (Māhismatī).<br><br>The King of Avanti was Pajjota, a man of violent temper Vin.i.277 and therefore known as Caṇḍa Pajjota. He wished to conquer the neighbouring kingdom of Kosambī, of which Udena was king, but his plans did not work out as he had anticipated.<br><br>The kingdom of Assaka is invariably mentioned in connection with Avanti. Even in the Buddha’s life-time, Avanti became a centre of Buddhism. Among eminent monks and nuns who were either born or resided there, are to be found.<br><br>- Mahā Kaccāna<br>- Nanda Kumāraputta<br>- Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa<br>- Dhammapāla<br>- Abhayarājakumāra<br>- Isidatta and Isidāsī<br><br>Mahā Kaccāna seems to have spent a good deal of his time in Avanti, dwelling in the city of Kuraraghara in the Papāta Pabbata (SN.iii.9; SN.iii.12; SN.iv.115–16; AN.v.46). He experienced great difficulty in collecting ten monks, in order that Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa might receive the higher Ordination; in fact it was not until three years had elapsed that he succeeded. Vin.i.195 Later, when Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa visited the Buddha at Sāvatthī, he conveyed to the Buddha Mahā Kaccāna’s request that special rules might be laid down for the convenience of the monks of Avanti Dakkhiṇāpatha and of other border countries. Vin.i.197–198 The Buddha agreed, and among the rules so laid down were the following.<br><br>- The higher Ordination could be given with only four monks and a Vinayadhara.<br><br>- Monks are allowed the use of shoes with thick linings (because in Avanti the soil is black on the surface, rough and trampled by cattle).<br><br>- Monks are enjoined to bathe frequently.<br><br>- Sheepskins, goatskins, etc., could be used as coverlets.<br><br>- Robes could be accepted on behalf of a monk who has left the district, and the ten days’ rule with regard to such a gift will not begin until the robes have actually reached the monk’s hands. Vin.iii.195–196<br><br>By the time of the Vesāli Council, however, Avanti had become one of the important centres of the orthodox school, for we find Yasa Kākandakaputta sending messengers to Avanti to call representatives to the Council, and we are told that eighty-eight arahants obeyed the summons. Vin.ii.298–299<br><br>Even in the Buddha’s day there were rumours of the King of Avanti making preparations to attack Māgadha, but we are not told that he ever did so. MN.iii.7 Subsequently, however, before the time of Candagupta, Avanti became incorporated with Māgadha.<br><br>Avanti is now identified with the country north of the Vindhaya Mountains and north-east of Bombay, roughly corresponding to modern Mālwa, Nimār and adjoining parts of the Central Provinces.",

The people of Ceti settled near the Yamunā, to the east, in the neighbourhood of and contiguous to the settlement of the Kurus, for we are told Vin.iv.108f. that the Buddha, having dwelt in the Ceti country, went to Bhaddavatikā, where, at the Ambatiṭṭha, Sāgata tamed a Nāga, and from there he went to Kosambī.<br><br>AN.iii.355f; AN.v.41f and AN.v.157ff are discources preached to the Cetis by Mahācunda. While dwelling in the Pācīnavaṁsadāya in the Ceti country, Anuruddha became an arahant after a visit which the Buddha paid to him (AN.iv.228; Vin.i.300f). The Janavasabha Sutta DN.ii.200 leads us to infer that the Buddha visited the Ceti country several times. The Saṁyutta Nikāya SN.v.436f. records a discussion on the four Ariyan Truths among a number of monks, including Gavampati, dwelling at Sahajāti.",

The Vinaya, Vin.i.28l however, mentions a Kāsika-rājā who sent a robe to Jīvaka. Even at this time, however, the memory of Kāsi as an independent kingdom seems to have been still fresh in men’s minds. It is very frequently mentioned as such in the Jātakas and elsewhere. Kāsi was once ruled by the Bhāratas, one of whom, Dhataraṭṭha, was its king in the time of Reṇu. DN.ii.235f. There seem to have been frequent wars between the countries of Kāsi and Kosala, victory belonging now to one, now to the other. In one such war, Dīghāti the Kosala king, was defeated by the king of Kāsi, but Dīghīti’s son Dīghāvu won back the kingdom. Vin.i.334<br><br>The traditional name of the king of Kāsi from time immemorial was evidently Brahmadatta, and references to kings of that name abound in the Jātakas. Among other kings of Kāsi mentioned is Kikī . MN.ii.49<br><br>Kāsi was evidently a great centre of trade and a most populous and prosperous country. Frequent mention is made of caravans leaving Kāsi to travel for trade. One highway went through Kāsi to Rājagaha Vin.i.212 and another to Sāvatthī. Vin.ii.10 Kāsi was famed for her silks, and Kāsi-robes were most highly esteemed as gifts. Mention is also made of the perfumes of Kāsi. AN.iii.391<br><br>Besides those already referred to, other names of places mentioned in literature as belonging to Kāsi, are Vāsabhagāma, Macchikāsaṇḍa, Kīṭāgiri and Dhammapālagāma. Kāsi and Kosala are frequently mentioned together. AN.v.59. Kāsigāma or Kāsinigama was probably the actual name of the village in Kāsi which was given by Mahākosala to his daughter when she married Bimbisāra. The village produced a revenue of one hundred thousand, and was given to the queen for her bath and perfume money. After Bimbisāra’s death, Pasenadi withdrew the gift from Ajātasattu, which act was the cause of a war between the two. Later, when Pasenadi’s daughter Vajirā was married to Ajātasattu, the village was given back as part of her dowry. SN.i.82ff.",

              "description": "A country inhabited by the Kosalans, to the north-west of Māgadha and next to Kāsī. It is mentioned second in the list of sixteen Great Nations (AN.i.213; AN.iv.252). In the Buddha’s time it was a powerful kingdom ruled over by Pasenadi, who was succeeded by his son Viḍūḍabha. By this time Kāsī was under the subjection of Kosala. With the capture of Kāsi the power of Kosala increased rapidly, until a struggle between this country and Māgadha became inevitable. Quite soon after Bimbisāra’s death there were many fierce fights between Ajātasattu, his successor, and Pasenadi, these fights bringing varying fortunes to the combatants. The Sutta Nipāta (Snp.405; AN.i.276) speaks of the Buddha’s birthplace as belonging to the Kosalans. Elsewhere. MN.ii.124 Pasenadi is reported as saying, that both the Buddha and he were Kosalans.<br><br>At the time of the Buddha Sāvatthī was the capital of Kosala. Next in importance was Sāketa. There was also Ayojjha, on the banks of the Sarayu.<br><br>Other Kosala rivers mentioned in the books are the Aciravatī DN.i.235 and the Sundarikā (SN.i.167; Snp.p.97) which is sometimes called Bāhukā. MN.i.39<br><br>Among localities spoken of as being in Kosala are Icchānaṅgala (AN.iii.30; AN.iii.341; AN.iv.340), Ukkaṭṭha (DN.i.87), Ekasālā (SN.i.111), Opasāda (MN.ii.164), Kesaputta of the Kālāmas (AN.i.188), Candalakappa (MN.ii.209), Toraṇavatthu (SN.iv.374), Dandakappa (AN.iii.402), Nagaravinda (MN.iii.290), Naḷakapāna (AN.v.122; MN.i.462), Nāḷandā (SN.iv.322), Pankadhā (AN.i.236), Venāgapura (AN.i.180), Veḷudvāra (SN.v.352) Sālā (MN.i.285; MN.i.400; SN.v.227), Sālāvatika (DN.i.244) and Setavya (DN.ii.316).<br><br>The Buddha spent the greater part of his time in Kosala, either in Sāvatthī or in touring in the various parts of the country, and many of the Vinaya rules were formulated in Kosala.<br><br>Kosala is often mentioned in combination with Kāsi in the compound Kāsi-Kosala; Pasenadi was king of Kāsi-Kosala.

During the Buddha’s time the chieftain of Kuru was called Koravya, and his discussion with the Elder Raṭṭhapāla, who was himself the scion of a noble family of the Kurus, is recounted in the Raṭṭhapāla Sutta.MN.ii.65ff. Koravya had a park called Migacīra. Discourses to the Kurus include the Mahānidāna Sutta, the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta, the Māgaṇḍiya Sutta, the Anañjasappāya Sutta, the Sammosa Sutta and the Ariyavasā Sutta. All these were preached at Kammāssadhamma, which is described as a nigama of the Kurūs, where the Buddha resided from time to time. Another town of the Kurūs, which we find mentioned, is Thullakoṭṭhika, the birthplace of Raṭṭhapāla, and here the Buddha stayed during a tour. MN.ii.54<br><br>The Kuru country is generally identified as the district around Thānesar, with its capital Indapatta, near the modern Delhi.",

Māgadha formed one of the sixteen Mahājanapadas and had its capital at Rājagaha or Giribbaja where Bimbisāra, and after him Ajātasattu, reigned. Later, Pāṭaliputta became the capital. By the time of Bimbisāra, Aṅga, too, formed a part of Māgadha, and he was known as king of Aṅga Māgadha. Thus Bimbisāra sends for Soṇa Koḷivisa, a prominent citizen of Campā, capital of Aṅga. Vin.i.27 In the Buddha’s day, Māgadha consisted of eighty thousand villages. Vin.i.179<br><br>Ajātasattu succeeded in annexing Kosala with the help of the Licchavis, and he succeeded also in bringing the confederation of the latter under his sway; preliminaries to this struggle are mentioned in the books (DN.ii.73f; DN.ii.86).<br><br>At the time of the Buddha, the kingdom of Māgadha was bounded on the east by the river Campā, on the south by the Vindhyā Mountains, on the west by the river Soṇa, and on the north by the Ganges. The latter river formed the boundary between Māgadha and the republican country of the Licchavis, and both the Māgadhas and the Licchavis evidently had equal rights over the river.<br><br>During the early Buddhist period Māgadha was an important political and commercial centre, and was visited by people from all parts of Northern India in search of commerce and of learning. The kings of Māgadha maintained friendly relations with their neighbours, Bimbisāra and Pasenadi marrying each other’s sisters. When Candappajjota of Ujjeni was suffering from jaundice, Bimbisāra sent him his own personal physician, Jīvaka.<br><br>In Māgadha was the real birth of Buddhism (see, e.g., the words put in the mouth of Sahampati: pātur ahosi Magadhesu pubbe dhammo Vin.i.5 ), and it was from Māgadha that it spread after the Third Council. The Buddha’s chief disciples, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, came from Māgadha. The cornfields of Māgadha were rich and fertile. Thag.208<br><br>The names of several places in Māgadha occur in the books—e.g., Ekanālā, NāIakagāma, Senānigama, Khāṇumata, Andhakavindha, Macala, Matula, Ambalaṭṭhikā, Pāṭaligāma, NāIandā and SāIindiya.<br><br>Māgadha is identified with the modern South Behar.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG2BVr-8sM4\"><img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/aG2BVr-8sM4/hqdefault.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /></a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aG2BVr-8sM4\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/aG2BVr-8sM4</a>",

              "description": "The name of a people and their country.<br><br>The country is included in the sixteen Great Nations of the Buddha’s time. The kingdom, at that time, was divided into two parts, having their respective capitals in Pāvā and Kusinārā. The Mallas of Pāvā were called Pāveyyakā Mallā, those of Kusināra, Kosinārakā. That these were separate kingdoms is shown by the fact that after the Buddha’s death at Kusināra, the Mallas of Pāvā sent messengers to claim their share of the Buddha’s relics. DN.ii.165 Each had their Mote Hall.<br><br>In the Saṅgīti Sutta we are told that the Buddha, in the course of one of his journeys, came with five hundred followers to Pāvā and stayed in the Ambavana of Cunda the smith. A new Mote Hall, called Ubbhataka, had just been completed for the Mallas of Pāvā, and the Buddha was invited to be the first to occupy it that it might be consecrated thereby. The Buddha accepted the invitation, and preached in the Hall far into the night. It was also at Pāvā that the Buddha took his last meal, of Sūkaramaddava, at the house of Cunda. DN.ii.126f. From there he went to Kusinārā, and there, as he lay dying, he sent Ānanda to the Mallas of Kusināra, who were assembled in their Mote Hall to announce his approaching death. The Mallas thereupon came to the Upavattana Sāla grove where the Buddha was, in order to pay him their last respects. Ānanda made them stand in groups according to family, and then presented them to the Buddha, announcing the name of each family. After the Buddha’s death, they met together once more in the Mote Hall, and made arrangements to pay him all the honour due to a Cakkavatti. They cremated the Buddha’s body at the Makuṭabandhana cetiya, and then collected the relics, which they deposited in their Mote Hall, surrounding them with a lattice work of spears and a rampart of bows till they were distributed among the various claimants by Doṇa. DN.ii.166 The Mallas, both of Pāvā and Kusināra, erected thūpas over their respective shares of the relics and held feasts in their honour. DN.ii.167<br><br>The Malla capital of Kusinārā was, in the Buddha’s day, a place of small importance. Ānanda contemptuously refers to it as a “little wattle and daub town in the midst of a jungle, a branch township,” quite unworthy of being the scene of the Buddha’s Parinibbāna. But the Buddha informs Ānanda that it was once Kusāvatī, the mighty capital of Kusa and Mahāsudassana. They were regarded, together with the Vajjis, as a typical example of a republic. MN.i.231 The chief Mallas administered the state in turn.<br><br>Both the Buddha and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta appear to have had followers among the Mallas. Pāvā was the scene of Nāṭaputta’s death, just as Kusinārā was of the Buddha’s. Several followers of the Buddha among the Mallas are mentioned by name—e.g., Dabba, Pukkusa, Khaṇḍasumana, Bhadragaka, Rāsiya, Rojā and Sīha.<br><br>Other places in the Malla country, besides Pāvā and Kusinārā, are mentioned where the Buddha stayed—e.g., Bhoganagara, Anupiya and Uruvelakappa, near which was the Mahāvana, a wide tract of forest.",

In the time of the Buddha, both Vesāli and Mithilā were republics, though Mithilā had earlier been a kingdom under Janaka.<br><br>In the time of the Buddha, and even up to his death, the Vajjians were a very prosperous and happy community. The Buddha attributed this to the fact that they practiced the seven conditions of welfare taught to them by himself in the Sārandada Cetiya.<br><br>The Buddha travelled several times through the Vajjian country, the usual route being through Kosala, Malla, Vajji, Kāsi, Māgadha, and thus back, SN.v.348 and he preached to the people, mostly in the Kūṭāgārasālā in Vesāli. Among other places besides Vesāli visited by the Buddha, are mentioned Ukkacela, Koṭigāma, Nādikā, Beluvagāma, Bhaṇḍagāma, Bhogagāma and Hatthigāma. Pubbavijjhana, the birthplace of Channa, is also mentioned as a village of the Vajjians. SN.iv.59 The Vaggumudā river flowed through Vajjian territory.

The territories of the Sākiyans and the Koliyans were adjacent, separated by the river Rohinī. Attached probably to the Koliyan central authorities, was a special body of officials, presumably police, who wore a distinguishing headdress with a drooping crest (Lambacūlakābhatā). They bore a bad reputation for extortion and violence (S.iv.341).<br><br>After the Buddha's death the Koliyans of Rāmagāma claimed and obtained one-eighth of the Buddha's relics, over which they erected a thūpa (D.ii.167; Mhv.Xxi.18, 22ff).",

They were certainly khattiyas, for on that ground they claimed a share of the Buddha’s relics DN.ii.165<br>Their capital was Vesāli, and they formed a part of the Vajjian confederacy, being often referred to as the Vajjīs. They were beautiful to look at and wore brilliantly coloured garments, riding in brightly painted carriages DN.ii.96;AN.iii.219. The Buddha once compared them to the gods of Tāvatiṁsā DN.ii.96.<br>Though this would seem to indicate that they were very prosperous and rich, they do not appear to have lived in luxury and idleness. They are, on the contrary, spoken of SN.ii.267f as sleeping on straw couches, being strenuous and diligent and zealous in their service. They also practised seven conditions of welfare, which the Buddha claimed to have taught them at the Sārandada cetiya. DN.ii.73f<br>The young men among the Licchavis were evidently fond of archery, for mention is made in AN.iii.76. They were a martial people and fond of “sport,” but we find one of their Elders, Mahānāma complaining AN.iii.76 of them to the Buddha—“The Licchavi youths are quick tempered, rough and greedy fellows; such presents as are sent by the members of their tribe ... they loot and eat; they slap the women and girls on the back.” Violation of chastity was considered a serious offence, and the assembly would even give its consent to a husband’s request that his unfaithful wife should be murdered. Vin.iv.225<br>The Licchavis were devout followers of the Buddha and held him in the highest esteem. Five hundred Licchavis once gave a garment each to Piṅgiyāni, because he recited a verse in praise of the Buddha AN.iii.239. Even careless boys, referred to above as wandering about with hounds and bows and arrows, would lay aside their arms when they saw the Buddha seated under a tree and would surround him with clasped hands, eager to hear him AN.iii.76. Vesāli was also a stronghold of the Jains. The Buddha visited Vesāli at least three times, and is frequently mentioned as staying in Kūṭāgārasālā in Mahāvana. There the Licchavis visited him in large numbers, sometimes AN.v.133f disturbing the calm of the spot and obliging resident monks to seek peace in Gosiṅgasālavana near by. Once, five hundred Licchavis invited the Buddha to a discussion held by them at the Sārandada-cetiya regarding the five kinds of treasures. The Buddha went and gave his opinion. AN.iii.167f<br>Not all the Licchavis were followers of the Buddha. When Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha visited the Buddha at Mahāvana, he was accompanied by five hundred Licchavis, who did not all salute the Buddha as their teacher, but showed him only such respect as was due to an honoured stranger MN.i.229. Several eminent Licchavis are specially mentioned by name as having visited and consulted the Buddha. Several Licchavis, both men and women, joined the Order.<br>The Licchavis were greatly admired for their system of government. It was a republic (gaṇa, saṅghā), all the leading members of which were called rājā. They held full and frequent assemblies at which problems affecting either the whole republic or individual members were fully discussed. The Buddha enjoins on the monks the observance of the same habits as practised by the Licchavis. These are given at. DN.ii.76f;Vin.i.56<br>The Licchavis seem to have been on friendly terms with their neighbours. MN.ii.101<br>After the death of Bimbisāra, Ajātasattu, resolved to destroy the Licchavis. In order to discover what the Buddha thought of his chances of success, he sent to him his minister. The Buddha predicted DN.ii.72ff that as long as the Licchavis remained united they were proof against any foe.",

              "description": "A tribe in North India, to which the Buddha belonged. Their capital was Kapilavatthu. Mention is also made of other Sākyan settlements - e.g., Cātumā, Khomadussa, Sāmagāma, Devadaha, Sīlavatī, Nagaraka, Medatalumpa, Sakkhara and Ulumpa (q.v.). Within the Sākyan tribe there were probably several clans, gottā. The Buddha himself belonged to the Gotamagotta. It has been suggested (E.g., Thomas, op. cit., 22) that this was a brahmin clan, claiming descent from the ancient isi Gotama. The evidence for this suggestion is, however, very meagre. Nowhere do we find the Sākyans calling themselves brahmins. On the other hand, we find various clans claiming a share of the Buddha's relics on the ground that they, like the Buddha, were khattiyas (D.ii.165). It is stated a that the Sākyans were a haughty people (Vin.ii.183; D.i.90; J. i.88; DhA.iii.163). Hiouen Thsang, however, found them obliging and gentle in manners (Beal., op. cit., ii.14).<br><br>When the Buddha first visited them, after his Enlightenment, they refused to honour him on account of his youth. The Buddha then performed a miracle and preached the Vessantara Jātaka, and their pride was subdued. They evidently fond of sports and mention is made of a special school of archery conducted by a Sākyan family, called Vedhaññā (D.iii.117; DA.iii.905). <br>The Sākyans evidently had no king. Theirs was a republican form of government, probably with a leader, elected from time to time. The administration and judicial affairs of the gotta were discussed in their Santhāgāra, or Mote Hall, at Kapilavatthu. See, e.g., D.i.91; the Sākyans had a similar Mote Hall at Cātumā (M.i.457). The Mallas of Kusinārā also had a Santhāgāra (D.ii.164); so did the Licchavis of Vesāli (Vin.i.233; M.i.228).<br><br>Ambattha (q.v.) once visited it on business; so did the envoys of Pasenadi, when he wished to marry a Sākyan maiden (see below). A new Mote Hall was built at Kapilavatthu while the Buddha was staying at the Nigrodhārāma, and he was asked to inaugurate it. This he did by a series of ethical discourses lasting through the night, delivered by himself, Ananda, and Moggallāna. M.i.353f.; S. iv.182f; the hall is described at SA.iii.63; cf. UdA.409.<br><br>The Sākyans were very jealous of the purity of their race; they belonged to the Ādiccagotta, (ādiccā nāma gottena, Sākiyā nāma jātiyā, Sn. vs.423) and claimed descent from Okkāka (q.v.). Their ancestors were the nine children of Okkāka, whom he banished in order to give the kingdom to Jantukumāra, his son by another queen. These nine children went towards Himavā, and, having founded Kapilavatthu (q.v. for details), lived there. To the eldest sister they gave the rank of mother, and the others married among themselves. The eldest sister, Piyā, later married Rāma, king of Benares, and their descendants became known as the Koliyans (see Koliyā for details). When Okkāka heard of this, he praised their action, saying, \"Sakyā vata bho kumārā, paramasakyā vata bho rājakumāra; hence their name came to be \"Sakyā.\"<br><br>The Buddha states, in the Aggañña Sutta, that the Sākyans were vassals of King Pasenadi of Kosala. D.iii.83 (Sakyā . . . Pasenadi-Kosalassa anuyuttā bhavanti, karonti Sakyā rañño Pasenadimhi Kosale nipaccakāram abhivādanam paccupatthānam añjalikammam sāmīcikammam); cf. Sn.vs 422, where the Buddha describes his country as being \"Kosalesu niketino.\"",

In earlier times Videha was evidently a kingdom, its best known kings being Mahājanaka and Nimi; but in the Buddha’s time it was a republic, part of the Vajjian federation. According to the Mahāgovinda Sutta, DN.ii.235 it was King Reṇu who, with the help of Mahāgovinda Jotipāla, founded the Videha kingdom.",

In the district was the brahmin village of Ekanālā. Snp.p.13 The Buddha traversed it in the course of his periodical tours through Māgadha, residing in the Dakkhiṇāgiri monastery in Ekanālā (SN.i.172; Vin.i.80). It was during one of these tours that he converted Kasī-Bhāradvāja and Dhammasava and his father. On another of these occasions the Buddha saw the Magadhakhetta, which gave him the idea of designing the robe of a monk to resemble a field Vin.i.287 Ānanda is also said to have travelled through Dakkhiṇāgiri, gathering a large number of young men into the Order, who, however, do not appear to have been very serious in their intentions, as their behaviour earned for Ānanda the censure of Mahā Kassapa. SN.ii.217f. Later, we find Puṇṇa with a large following in Dakkhiṇāgiri refusing to join in the findings of the Rājagaha Council, and preferring to follow the Dhamma according to his own lights. Vin.ii.289<br><br>Dakkhiṇāgiri was the residence of Nandamātā of Velukantaka and she was visited both by Sāriputta and by Moggallāna during a tour in the district. AN.iv.64 In Dakkhiṇāgiri, Sāriputta heard of the lack of zeal of Dhānañjāni. MN.ii.185",

              "description": "In the old Pali literature the name Dakkhinapatha would seem to indicate only a remote settlement or colony on the banks of the upper Godavari. Thus, we are told that Bavari had his hermitage in Dakkhinapatha territory, midway between the kingdoms of Assaka and Alaka (Snp. vs.976). Elsewhere the name is coupled with Avanti as Avantidakkhinapatha and seems to refer, but more vaguely, to the same limited district. Vin.i.195, 196; ii.298. In J.v.133, however, Avanti is spoken of as a part of Dakkhinapatha (Dakkhinupathe Avantirattha), but see J.iii.463, where Avantidakkhinapatha is spoken of.<br><br>The Sutta Nipata Commentary (ii.580) seems to explain Dakkhinapatha as the road leading to the Dakkhinajanapada, while the Sumangala Vilasini (DA.i.265) takes Dakkhinapatha to be synonymous with Dakkhinajanapada and says that it was the district (janapada) south of the Ganges (Gangaya dakkhinato pakatajanapadam).<br><br>It is clear that, in the earlier literature at any rate, the word did not mean the whole country comprised in the modern word Dekkhan. It is possible that Dakkhinapatha was originally the name of the road which led southwards - the Aryan settlement at the end of the road, on the banks of the Godavari being also called by the same name - and that later the road lent its name to the whole region through which it passed. (For a detailed description see Law: Geog. of Early Buddhism, pp.60ff). In the Petavatthu Commentary (PvA., p.133) the Damila country (Damilavisaya) is included in the Dakkhinapatha.<br><br>The Dakkhinapatha is famous in literature as the birthplace of strong bullocks (DhSA.141; NidA.16; DhA.iii.248, etc.). It held also a large number of ascetics (DA.i.265), and in the southern districts (Dakkhinesu janapadesu) people celebrated a feast called Dharana (A.v.216). See Dharana Sutta.",
