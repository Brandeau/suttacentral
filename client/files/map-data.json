It was one of the four places of pilgrimage for the Buddhists - the others being Kapilavatthu, Buddhagayā and Kusināra - because it was at, the Migadāya in Isipatana near Bārānasī that the Buddha preached his first sermon to the Pañcavaggiyā (D.ii.141). This was the spot at which all Buddhas set in motion the Wheel of the Law (Dhamma-cakka). It is the custom of Buddhas to travel by air from the Bodhi-tree to the scene of their first sermon, a distance of eighteen leagues (MA.i.388; Bu.A.242, etc.), but the present Buddha did all the journey on foot in order to be able to meet on the way the Ajīvaka Upaka.<br><br>Benares was an important centre of trade and industry. There was direct trade between there and Sāvatthi (DhA.iii.429), the road passing through Bhaddiya (Vin.i.189), and between there and Takkasilā (DhA.i.123). It was the custom for enthusiastic young men of Benares to go to the university at Takkasilā (E.g., J.ii.4; DhA.i.250), but there seem to have been educational institutions at Benares also, some of which were older than even those of Takkasilā (KhA.198; see also DhA.iii.445, where Susīma, Sankha's son, goes from Takkasilā to Benares for purposes of study).<br><br>From Verañjā to Benares there seem to have been two routes: one rather circuitous, passing through Soreyya, and the other direct, crossing the Ganges at Payāgatittha. From Benares the road continued to Vesāli (Sp.i.201). On the road from Benares to Rājagaha was Andhakavinda (Vin.i.220). There seems to have been friendly intercourse between the chieftains of Benares and the kings of Magadha, as shown by the fact that Bimbisāra sent his own physician, Jīvaka, to attend to the son of the Treasurer of Benares (Vin.i.275). The distance from Kosambī to Benares was thirty leagues by river (MA.ii.929).<br><br>The extent of the city of Benares, including its suburbs, at the time when it was the capital of an independent kingdom, is often stated (E.g., J.iv.377; vi.160; MA.ii.608) to have been twelve leagues. The names of several kings are mentioned in the Jātakas, among them being those of Anga, Uggasena, Udaya, Kikī, Dhanañjaya, Mahāsīlava, Vissasena, and Samyama. (The SNA. on the Khaggavisāna Sutta contains the names of several kings of Benares who renounced the world and became Pacceka Buddhas).<br><br>The name which occurs most frequently, however, is that of Brahmadatta, which seems to have been the dynastic name of the Benares kings. In the Mahāgovinda Sutta, the foundation of Bārānasī is attributed to Mahāgovinda, its first king being Dhatarattha, contemporary of Renu (D.ii.235). The Ceylon Chronicles (MT. 127,129,130) mention the names of others who reigned in Benares - e.g., Duppasaha and sixty of his descendants; Asoka, son of Samankara, and eighty four thousand of his descendants; also sixteen kings, ancestors of Okkāka. The city itself had been known by different names at different periods; thus, in the time of the Udaya Jātaka it was called Surundhana; in that of the Sutasoma, Sudassana; in that of the Sonananda, Brahmavaddhana; in that of the Khandahāla, Pupphavatī; in that of the Yuvañjaya, Rammanagara (J.iv.119f); and in that of the Sankha, Molinī (J.iv.15). It was also called Kāsinagara and Kāsipura (E.g., J.v.54; vi.165; DhA.i.87), being the capital of Kāsi. The Bhojājāniya Jātaka (J.i.178) says that \"all the kings around coveted the kingdom of Benares.\" In the Brahāchatta Jātaka (J.iii.116), the king of Benares is mentioned as having captured the whole of Kosala. At the time of the Buddha, however, Benares had lost its great political importance. Kosala was already the paramount power in India, and several successful invasions of Kāsi by the Kosalans under their kings Vanka, Dabbasena and Kamsa, are referred to. The final conquest would seem to be ascribed to Kamsa because the epithet Bārānasīggha (conqueror of Benares) is an established addition to his name (J.ii.403).<br><br>Later, when Ajātasattu succeeded in establishing his sway over Kos<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUFyIAoeKeAtVkVUc7H_O6CdBpBV2SWOl7Ox8ExjrRdkrhTop6Dlftt8kW6UeKV_4hv271gBgpedw8v_8_Ao4vY7SP1oPT6gRCDiMOPS6kMeNU5SawkV8w\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUFkseEiCl4P07goQA7SCelu0CDvwLxnRLG9iZvuWNc-GqSQCpRGbAT0RflrspKcMz7aMKR9DyV2iPmJ4ngUsXeqGHED0oP6GnsjXl3e1Arx\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUFid-79gsda-BPQxDKnmsxaZKYIyUhOqenomXBk4yArsPI6EhuSDY3frot4pUhS5GCx-LWhyWJz8vgKQoSatne2YHkVYgoHQ3UpTWV0gMopF1cZdUjYZW6MAlcSElHosDI\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUHReSVEMEaGkBuIbkBj8We5zQ8zBecRFP79jFb5vwnFWL-E3CzWzU4SkZotxvdasmj9PrVJiS2TLHUKu-zAHpH8M73Tsit7WLiO4QZIakqfqQU31KIBOIyZhi9o67zIRlpL\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />",

The administration and judicial business of the city and all other matters of importance were discussed and decided in the Santhāgārasālā. DN.i.91 The Buddha and his company lived in the Nigrodhārāma or the Mahāvana. When the Buddha returned a few years after his enlightenment, he met many of his family, and several of them ordained, including Nanda and Rāhula. Vin.i.82Vin.ii.180 <br><br>The Buddha certainly paid other visits besides these to Kapilavatthu. Various Sākyans went to see him both at the Nigrodhārāma and at the Mahāvana, among them being Mahānāma (SN.v.369f; AN.iii.284f; AN.iv.220f; AN.v.320f), Nandiya (SN.v.403f; SN.v.397f; AN.v.334f), Vappa (AN.ii.196; MN.i.91) and perhaps Sārakāni (SN.v.372).<br><br>During one visit the Buddha was entrusted with the consecration of a new mote-hall, built by the Sākyans; he preached far into the night in the new building, and, when weary, asked Moggallāna to carry on while he slept. On this occasion was preached the Sekha Sutta. MN.i.353ff.<br><br>The books record a visit paid by the Brahmā Sahampati to the Buddha in the Mahāvana at Kapilavatthu. The Buddha, worried by the noisy behavior of some monks who had recently been admitted into the Order, was wondering how he could impress on them the nature of their calling. Sahampati visited him and, being thus encouraged, the Buddha returned to Nigrodhārāma and there performed a miracle before the monks; seeing them impressed, he talked to them on the holy life (SN.iii.91f; .Ud.25).<br><br>A curious incident is related in connection with a visit paid by the Buddha to Kapilavatthu, when he went there after his rounds among the Kosalans. Mahānāma was asked to find a place of lodging for the night; he searched all through the town without success, and at length the Buddha was compelled to spend the night in the hermitage of Bharaṇḍu, the Kālāman. AN.i.276f. On another occasion we hear of the Buddha convalescing at Kapilavatthu after an illness. AN.i.219<br><br>Not all the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu believed in their kinsman’s great powers. We find, for instance, Daṇḍapāṇi meeting the Buddha in the Mahāvana and, leaning on his staff, questioning him as to his tenets and his gospel. We are told that in answer to the Buddha’s explanations, Daṇḍapāṇi shook his head, waggled his tongue, and went away, still leaning on his staff, his brow puckered into three wrinkles. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Madhupiṇḍika Sutta. MN.i.108f.<br><br>Others were more convinced and patronised the Order—e.g., Kāla-Khemaka and Ghaṭāya, who built cells for monks in the Nigrodhārāma, as a result of noticing which the Buddha preached the Mahāsuññata Sutta. MN.iii.109<br><br>Mahānāma was the Buddha’s most frequent visitor; to him was preached the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha Sutta. MN.i.91f.<br><br>The Dakkhiṇā-vibhaṅga Sutta was preached as the result of a visit to the Buddha by Mahā-Pajāpatī-Gotamī. Apart from those already mentioned, another Sākyan lady lived in Kapilavatthu, Kāḷigodhā by name, and she was the only kinsman, with the exception of the Buddha’s father and wife, to be specially visited by the Buddha. SN.v.396<br><br>The inhabitants of Kapilavatthu are called Kāpilavatthavā. SN.iv.182<br><br>From Kapilavatthu lay a direct road to Vesālī, Vin.ii.253 and through Kapilavatthu passed the road taken by Bāvarī’s disciples from Alaka to Sāvatthī. Snp.p.194<br><br>It was not mentioned by Ānanda among the great cities, in one of which, in his opinion, the Buddha could more fittingly have died than in Kusinārā. DN.ii.146 After the Buddha’s death, a portion of the relics was claimed by the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu, and a shrine to hold them was erected in the city.

In the time of the Buddha its king was Parantapa, and after him reigned his son Udena. Kosambī was evidently a city of great importance at the time of the Buddha for we find Ānanda mentioning it as one of the places suitable for the Buddha’s Parinibbāna (DN.ii.146; DN.ii.169). It was also the most important halt for traffic coming to Kosala and Māgadha from the south and the west. Vin.i.277<br><br>The usual route from Rājagaha to Kosambī was up the river. This was the route taken by Ānanda when he went with five hundred others to inflict the higher punishment on Channa, Vin.ii.290 though there seems to have been a land route passing through Anupiya and Kosambī to Rājagaha. Vin.ii.184f. In the Sutta Nipāta Snp.1010–1013 the whole route is given from Mahissati to Rājagaha, passing through Kosambī, the halting-places mentioned being Ujjeni, Gonaddha, Vedisa, Vanasavhya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthī, Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, Pāvā, Bhoganagara and Vesāli.<br><br>Near Kosambī, by the river, was Udena’s park, the Udakavana, where Ānanda and Piṇḍola-Bhāradvāja preached to the women of Udena’s palace on two different occasions. Vin.ii.290f. The Buddha is mentioned as having once stayed in the Siṁsapāvana in Kosambī. SN.v.437<br><br>Already in the Buddha’s time there were four establishments of the Order in Kosambī—the Kukkuṭārāma, the Ghositārāma, the Pāvārika-ambavana, and the Badarikārāma. The Buddha visited Kosambī on several occasions, stopping at one or other of these residences, and several discourses delivered during these visits are recorded in the books.<br><br>A great division once arose among the monks in Kosambī. Some monks charged one of their colleagues with having committed an offence, but he refused to acknowledge the charge and, being himself learned in the Vinaya, argued his case and pleaded that the charge be dismissed. The rules were complicated; on the one hand, the monk had broken a rule and was treated as an offender, but on the other, he should not have been so treated if he could not see that he had done wrong. The monk was eventually excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were exchanged. The people of Kosambī, becoming angry at the monks’ behaviour, the quarrel grew apace. The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the monks the story of King Dīghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle their differences without his interference. In disgust the Buddha left Kosambī and, journeying through Bālakaloṇakāragāma and the Pācīnavaṁsadāya, retired alone to keep retreat in the Pārileyyaka forest. In the meantime the monks of both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay followers in Kosambī, and, coming to the Buddha at Sāvatthī, they asked his pardon and settled their dispute. Vin.i.337–357 The story of the Buddha going into the forest is given in the Udāna Ud.iv.5 and in the Saṁyutta, SN.iii.94 but the reason given in these texts is that he found Kosambī uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and heretics.<br><br>During the time of the Vajjian heresy, when the Vajjian monks of Vesāli wished to excommunicate Yasa Kākandakaputta, he went by air to Kosambī, and from there sent messengers to the orthodox monks in the different centres. Vin.ii.298<br><br>It was at Kosambī that the Buddha promulgated a rule forbidding the use of intoxicants by monks. Vin.ii.307<br><br>Kosambī is mentioned in the Saṁyutta Nikāya SN.iv.179 as being on the Ganges, but here as elsewhere this simply means on a great river, in this case the Yamuna.",

At that time it was a small city, “a branch-township with wattle-and-daub houses in the midst of the jungle,” and Ānanda was, at first, disappointed that the Buddha should have chosen it for his Parinibbāna. But the Buddha pointed out to him that in ancient times it had been Kusāvatī, the royal city of Mahā-Sudassana. DN.ii.146ff. It was twelve leagues in length and twelve in breadth, prosperous and full of people, like Āḷakamandā. It was then at the head of eighty-four Towns. SN.iii.144. DN.ii.170f.<br><br>Between Kusinārā and Pāvā lay the stream of Kakuttha on the banks of which was the Ambavana; beyond that was the Hiraññavatī river.<br><br>After the Buddha’s death his body was carried into the city by the northern gate and out of the city by the eastern gate; to the east of the city was Makuṭabandhana, the shrine of the Mallas, and there the body was cremated. For seven days those assembled at the ceremony held a festival in honour of the relics. DN.ii.160f.<br><br>As the scene of his death, Kusinārā became one of the four holy places declared by the Buddha to be fit places of pilgrimage for the pious, the other three being Kapilavatthu, Buddhagayā and Isipatana. DN.ii.140 Mention is made of other visits paid to Kusinārā by the Buddha, prior to that when his death took place. Thus, once he went there from Āpaṇa and having spent some time at Kusinārā, proceeded to Ātumā. The Mallas of Kusinārā were always great admirers of the Buddha, even though not all of them were his followers, and on the occasion of this visit they decided that any inhabitant of Kusinārā who failed to go and meet the Buddha and escort him to the city, would be fined five hundred. It was on this occasion that Rojā the Mallan was converted and gave to the Buddha and the monks a supply of green vegetables and pastries. Vin.i.247f. During some of these visits the Buddha stayed in a wood called Baliharana, and there he preached two of the Kusinārā Suttas (AN.i.274f; AN.v.79f). and the “Kinti” Sutta. MN.ii.238f. A third Kusinārā Sutta he preached while staying at Upavattana. AN.ii.79Ud.iv.2<br><br>The people of Kusinārā are called Kosinārakā.

It is said MN.iii.68 that these hills, with the exception of Isigili, were once known by other names e.g., Vaṅkaka for Vepulla. SN.ii.191 The Saṁyutta SN.i.206 mentions another peak near Rājagaha—Indakūta.<br><br>Rājagaha was closely associated with the Buddha’s work. He visited it soon after the Renunciation. Bimbisāra saw him begging in the street, and questioned him as to his purpose. Snp.472–491 During the first year after the Enlightenment the Buddha went to Rājagaha from Gayā, after the conversion of the Tebhātika Jatilas. Bimbisāra and his subjects gave the Buddha a great welcome, and the king entertained him and a large following of monks in the palace. It is said that on the day of the Buddha’s entry into the royal quarters, Sakka led the procession, in the guise of a young man, singing songs of praise of the Buddha. Vin.i.35ff. Large numbers of householders joined the Order, and people blamed the Buddha for breaking up their families. But their censure lasted for only seven days. Among those ordained were the Sattarasavaggiyā with Upāli at their head.<br><br>The Buddha spent his first vassa in Rājagaha and remained there during the winter and the following summer. The people grew tired of seeing the monks everywhere, and, on coming to know of their displeasure, the Buddha went first to Dakkhiṇāgiri and then to Kapilavatthu. Vin.i.77ff.<br><br>Later the Buddha made Sāvatthī his headquarters, though he seems frequently to have visited and stayed at Rājagaha. It thus became the scene of several important suttas—e.g., the Āṭānāṭiya, Udumbarika and Kassapasīhanāda, Jīvaka, Mahāsakuladāyī, and Sakkapañha.<br><br>Many of the Vinaya rules were enacted at Rājagaha. Just before his death, the Buddha paid a last visit there. At that time, Ajātasattu was contemplating an attack on the Vajjians, and sent his minister, Vassakāra, to the Buddha at Gijjhakūṭa, to find out what his chances of success were. DN.ii.72<br><br>After the Buddha’s death, Rājagaha was chosen by the monks, with Mahā Kassapa at their head, as the meeting place of the First Convocation. This took place at the Sattapaṇṇiguhā, and Ajātasattu extended to the undertaking his whole hearted patronage. Vin.ii.285 The king also erected at Rājagaha a cairn over the relics of the Buddha, which he had obtained as his share. DN.ii.166<br><br>Rājagaha was one of the six chief cities of the Buddha’s time, and as such, various important trade routes passed through it. The others cities were Campā, Sāvatthī, Sāketa, Kosambī and Benares. DN.ii.147<br><br>The Parāyana Vagga Snp.1011–1013 mentions a long and circuitous route, taken by Bāvarī’s disciples in going from Patiṭṭhāna to Rājagaha, passing through Māhissati, Ujjeni, Gonaddha, Vedisa. Vanasavhaya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthī, Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, on to Rājagaha, by way of the usual places. The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta DN.ii.72ff. gives a list of the places at which the Buddha stopped during his last journey along that road—Ambalaṭṭhikā, Nāḷandā, Pāṭaligāma, Koṭigāma, Nādikā, Vesāli, Bhaṇḍagāma, Hatthigāma, Ambagāma, Jambugāma, Bhoganagara, Pāvā, and the Kakuttha River, beyond which lay the Mango grove and the Sāla grove of the Mallas.<br><br>The books mention various places besides Veḷuvana, with its Kalandaka-nivāpa vihāra in and around Rājagaha—e.g., Sītavana, Jīvaka’s Ambavana, Pipphaliguhā, Udumbarikārāma, Moranivāpa with its Paribbājakārāma, Tapodārāma, Indasālaguhā in Vediyagiri, Sattapaṇṇiguhā, Latthivana, Maddakucchi, Supatiṭṭhacetiya, Pāsānakacetiya, Sappasoṇḍikapabbhāra and the pond Sumāgadhā.<br><br>The city gates were closed every evening, and after that it was impossible to enter the city.

It is not possible to know how many visits were paid by the Buddha to Vesāli, but the books would lead us to infer that they were several.

Vin.ii.253ff.<br><br>The books describe DN.ii.95ff. at some length the Buddha’s last visit to Vesāli on his way to Kusinārā. On the last day of this visit, after his meal, he went with Ānanda to Cāpāla cetiya for his siesta, and, in the course of their conversation, he spoke to Ānanda of the beauties of Vesāli: of the Udena cetiya, the Gotamaka cetiya, the Sattambaka cetiya, the Bahuputta cetiya, and the Sārandada cetiya. Other monasteries are also mentioned, in or near Vesāli e.g., Pātikārāma, Vālikārāma.<br><br>The Buddha generally stayed at the Kūṭāgārasālā during his visits to Vesāli, but it appears that he sometimes lived at these different shrines. DN.ii.118 During his last visit to the Cāpāla cetiya he decided to die within three months, and informed Māra and, later, Ānanda, of his decision. The next day he left Vesāli for Bhaṇḍagāma, after taking one last look at the city, “turning his whole body round, like an elephant”. DN.ii.122 The rainy season which preceded this, the Buddha spent at Beluvagāma, a suburb of Vesāli, while the monks stayed in and around Vesāli. On the day before he entered into the vassa, Ambapāli invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal, at the conclusion of which she gave her Ambavana for the use of the Order. DN.ii.98<br><br>Among eminent followers of the Buddha who lived in Vesāli, special mention is made of Ugga, Piṅgiyāni, Kāraṇapālī, Sīha, Vāseṭṭha, AN.iv.258 and the various Licchavis.<br><br>Vesāli was a stronghold of the Nigaṇṭhas. The Buddha’s presence in Vesāli was a source of discomfort to the Nigaṇṭhas, and we find mention of various devices resorted to by them to prevent their followers from coming under the influence of the Buddha.<br><br>At the time of the Buddha, Vesāli was a very large city, rich and prosperous, crowded with people and with abundant food. Its courtesan, Ambapālī, was famous for her beauty, and helped in large measure in making the city prosperous. Vin.i.268<br><br>Outside the town was the Mahāvana, a large, natural forest. Near by were other forests, such as Gosiṅgalasāla. AN.v.134<br><br>Among important suttas preached at Vesāli are the Mahāli, Mahāsīhanāda, Cūḷa Saccaka, Mahā Saccaka, Tevijja, Vacchagotta, Sunakkhatta and Ratana.<br><br>One hundred years after the Buddha’s death Vesāli was again the scene of interest for Buddhists, on account of the “Ten Points” raised by the Vajjiputtaka, and the second Council held in connection with this dispute at the Vālikārāma.<br><br>There were Nāgas living in Vesāli; these were called Vesālā.

Although it later became the capital of Magadha, it was then a mere village. At that time Ajātasattu's ministers, Sunīdha and Vassakāra, were engaged in building fortifications there in order to repel the Vajjīs. The Buddha prophesied the future greatness of Pātaligāma, and also mentioned the danger of its destruction by fire, water, or internal discord. The gate by which the Buddha left the town was called Gotamadvāra, and the ferry at which he crossed the river, Gotamatittha (Vin.i.226 30; D.ii.86ff).<br><br>The date at which Pātaliputtta became the capital is uncertain. Hiouen Thsang seems to record (Beal: Records ii.85, n. 11) that it was Kālāsoka who moved the seat of government there. The Jains maintain that it was Udāyi, son of Ajātasattu (Vin. Texts ii.102, n. 1). The latter tradition is probably correct as, according to the Anguttara Nikāya (iii.57) even Munda is mentioned as residing at Pātaliputta. It was, however, in the time of Asoka that the city enjoyed its greatest glory. In the ninth year of his reign Asoka's income from the four gates of the city is said to have been four hundred thousand kahāpanas daily, with another one hundred thousand for his sabhā or Council (Sp.i.52).<br><br>The city was known to the Greeks as Pālibothra, and Megasthenes, who spent some time there, has left a vivid description of it (Buddhist India 262f). It continued to be the capital during the greater part of the Gupta dynasty, from the fourth to the sixth century A.C. Near Pātaliputta was the Kukkutārāma, where monks (e.g. Ananda, Bhadda and Nārada) stayed when they came to Pātaliputta (M.i.349; A.v.341; A.iii.57; S.v.15f; 171f). At the suggestion of Udena Thera, the brahmin Ghotamukha built an assembly hall for the monks in the city (M.ii.163).<br><br>Pātaligāma was so called because on the day of its foundation several pātali shoots sprouted forth from the ground. The officers of Ajātasattu and of the Licchavi princes would come from time to time to Pātaligāma, drive the people from their houses, and occupy them themselves. A large hall was therefore built in the middle of the village, divided into various apartments for the housing of the officers and their retainers when necessary. The Buddha arrived in the village on the day of the completion of the building, and the villagers invited him to occupy it for a night, that it might be blessed by his presence. On the next day they entertained the Buddha and his monks to a meal (Ud.viii.6; UdA.407ff).",

From Pāvā the Buddha journeyed on to Kusinārā, crossing the Kakkuṭṭhā on the way (DN.ii.126ff; Ud.viii.5). The road from Pāvā to Kusināra is mentioned several times in the books (Vin.ii.284; DN.ii.162). <br><br>According to the Saṅgīti Sutta, at the time the Buddha was staying at Pāvā, the Mallas had just completed their new Mote hall, Ubbhataka, and, at their invitation, the Buddha consecrated it by first occupying it and then preaching in it. After the Buddha had finished speaking, Sāriputta recited the Saṅgīti Sutta to the assembled monks.<br><br>Pāvā was also a centre of the Nigaṇṭhas and, at the time mentioned above, Nigaṇṭha Nāthaputta had just died at Pāvā and his followers were divided by bitter wrangles. DN.iii.210 Cunda Samaṇuddesa was spending his rainy season at Pāvā, and he reported to the Buddha, who was at Sāmagāma, news of the Nigaṇṭhas’ quarrels (DN.iii.117f; MN.ii.243f).<br><br>Mention is made in the Udāna Ud.i.7 of the Buddha having stayed at the Ajakapālaka cetiya in Pāvā.<br><br>After the Buddha’s death, the Mallas of Pāvā claimed a share in his relics.

DN.ii.146 In the Vinaya Vin.i.253 however, the distance between āvatthī and Sāketa is given as six leagues. The town lay on the direct route between Sāvatthī and Patiṭṭhāna, and is mentioned Snp.1011–1013 as the first stopping place out of Sāvatthī. The distance between the two places could be covered in one day, with seven relays of horses, MN.i.149 but the books contain several references (Vin.i.88; Vin.i.89; Vin.i.270; Vin.iii.212; Vin.iv.63; Vin.iv.120) to the dangers of the journey when undertaken on foot. The road was infested with robbers, and the king had to maintain soldiers to protect travellers.<br><br>Midway between Sāketa and Sāvatthī was Toraṇavatthu, and it is said SN.iv.374ff. that, when Pasenadi went from the capital to Sāketa, he spent a night in Toraṇavatthu, where be visited Khemā Therī who lived there. Between Sāketa and Sāvatthī was a broad river which could be crossed only by boat (Vin.iv.65; Vin.iv.228). Near Sāketa was the Añjanavana, where the Buddha sometimes stayed during his visits to Sāketa and where he had several discussions e.g., with Kakudha, SN.i.54 Mendasira, and Kuṇḍaliya. SN.v.73<br><br>On other occasions he stayed at the Kāḷakārāma AN.ii.24 gifted to the Order by Kāḷaka, and the Tikantakivana, AN.iii.169 both of which were evidently near the city. Mention is also made (SN.v.174; SN.v.298f; Vin.i.289) of Sāriputta, Moggallāna and Anuruddha staying together in Sāketa. Bhaddākāpilāni Vin.iv.292 also stayed there, so did Ānanda. Once when Ānanda was staying in the Migadāya in the Añjanavana, a nun, described as Jatilagāhikā, visited him and questioned him regarding concentration. AN.iv.427 Among others who lived in Sāketa were Jambugāmikaputta, Gavampati, Mendasira, Uttara, Madhuvāsettha and his son Mahānāga, and Visākhā. Bhūta Thera was born in a suburb of Sāketa.<br><br>The Vinaya Vin.i.270f. mentions another seṭṭhi of Sāketa. His wife had suffered for seven years from a disease of the head, and even skilled physicians failed to cure her. Jīvaka, on his way to Rājagaha, after finishing his studies in Takkasilā, visited Sāketa, heard of her illness, and offered to cure her. At first the seṭṭhi was sceptic, but in the end allowed Jīvaka to attend on his wife. Jīvaka cured her by the administration of ghee through the nose, and, as reward, received sixteen thousand kahāpanas from her and her various kinsmen.",

MN.i.166 The place chosen by the Bodhisatta for his penances was called Senānigama.<br><br>From Uruvelā the Buddha went to Isipatana, but after, he had made sixty-one arahants and sent them out on tour to preach the Doctrine, he returned to Uruvelā, to the Kappāsikavanasanda and converted the Bhaddavaggiyā. Vin.i.23f. At Uruvelā dwelt also the Tebhātika-Jatilas: Uruvelā-Kassapa, Nadī-Kassapa and Gayā-Kassapa, who all became followers of the Buddha. Vin.i.25<br><br>Mention is made of several temptations of the Buddha while he dwelt at Uruvelā, apart from the supreme contest with Māra, under the Bodhi-tree. Once Māra came to him in the darkness of the night in the guise of a terrifying elephant, trying to frighten him. On another dark night when the rain was falling drop by drop, Māra came to the Buddha and assumed various wondrous shapes, beautiful and ugly. Another time Māra tried to fill the Buddha’s mind with doubt as to whether he had really broken away from all fetters and won complete Enlightenment. SN.i.103ff. Seven years after the Buddha’s Renunciation, Māra made one more attempt to make the Buddha discontented with his lonely lot and it was then, when Māra had gone away discomfited, that Māra’s three daughters, Taṇhā, Ratī and Ragā, made a final effort to draw the Buddha away from his purpose. SN.i.124f.<br><br>It was at Uruvelā, too, that the Buddha had misgivings in his own mind as to the usefulness of preaching the Doctrine which he had realised, to a world blinded by passions and prejudices. The Brahmā Sahampati thereupon entreated the Buddha not to give way to such diffidence (SN.i.136ff; Vin.i.4f). It is recorded that either on this very occasion or quite soon after, the thought arose in the Buddha’s mind that the sole method of winning Nibbāna was to cultivate the four satipaṭṭhānas and that Sahampati visited the Blessed One and confirmed his view (SN.v.167; SN.v.185). A different version occurs elsewhere, SN.v.232 where the thought which arose in the Buddha’s mind referred to the five controlling faculties, and Brahmā tells the Buddha that in the time of Kassapa he had been a monk named Sahaka and that then he had practised these five faculties.<br><br><br><br>https://www.youtube.com/embed/qYOUSCDNFvI<br><br><br><br>https://www.youtube.com/embed/qYOUSCDNFvI<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYOUSCDNFvI\"><img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/qYOUSCDNFvI/hqdefault.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /></a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qYOUSCDNFvI\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/qYOUSCDNFvI</a><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUFT3Mj_zCFtTL0k7RtKDgn_37I9n7EYtFad8eNYsR-rWhdvhuL0f3eao4HNTBfuwSu1QewnN_2QUQa34YHIK79zG6ni9y4_7h0eAxseA1VOF4125i4Xqk3-icNzTgAH\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />",

Verañja visits the Buddha at the foot of the Naḷerupucimanda, where he is staying, and asks him a series of questions, the first of which is: whether it be true that the Buddha pays no respect to aged brahmins. The Buddha replies that he has not seen a brahmin in the whole world to whom such respect is due from him. If the Tathāgata were so to honour anyone, that person’s head would split in pieces. Other questions follow on the Buddha’s doctrine and practices. The Buddha concludes by giving an account of his attainment of the threefold knowledge. The interview ends with the conversion of Verañja and his invitation to the Buddha to spend his rainy season there.<br><br>At that time there was a famine, and five hundred householders of Uttarāpatha, staying at Verañjā, supplied the monks with food. Moggallāna proposed to get food by the exercise of his magic power or by going with the monks to Uttarakuru, but he was dissuaded by the Buddha. During this stay Sāriputta received from the Buddha an explanation as to why the religious systems of the three previous Buddhas lasted so long, while those of the three preceding them—​​Vipassī, Sikhī and Vesabhū—​​did not.<br><br>At the conclusion of the vassa, the Buddha wished to take leave of Verañja before setting out, as was the custom of Buddhas when they received hospitality. Verañja admitted that, though he had invited the Buddha, he had not kept his promise, and this was due to his having too many duties in the house.<br><br>He invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal the next day, and, at the end of the meal, presented a set of three robes to the Buddha and a pair to each of the monks.<br><br>After leaving Verañjā the Buddha went to Benares, passing through Soreyya, Saṅkassa and Kaṇṇakujja, and crossing the Ganges at Payāgapatiṭṭhāna. From Benares he proceeded to Vesāli. This account, of the Buddha’s visit to Verañjā, forms the introduction to the Vinaya. Vin.iii.1–11 The interview with Verañja is given in the Aṅguttara.

It was evidently a favourite resort of those who followed the religious life.<br><br>The Buddha seems to have been attracted by its solitude, and is mentioned as having visited it on several occasions, sometimes even in the dark, in drizzling rain, while Māra made unsuccessful attempts to frighten him. SN.i.109<br><br>It was on the slopes of Gijjhakūṭa, where the Buddha was wandering about, that Devadatta hurled at him a mighty stone to kill him, but only a splinter injured his foot. Vin.ii.193<br><br>Among those who visited the Buddha on Gijjhakūṭa are mentioned: Sahampati, SN.i.153 the youth Māgha, Snp.p.86 the Yakkha Inda, SN.i.206 Sakka (SN.i.233; SN.iv.102), the Paribbājaka Sajjha, AN.iv.371 the Kassapagotta monk, AN.i.237 Pañcasikha (SN.iv.103; DN.ii.220), Sutavā, AN.iv.369 the four kings of the Cātummahārājika world and their followers, DN.iii.195 Abhayarājakumāra, SN.v.126 Upaka Maṇḍikāputta, AN.ii.181 Dhammika,, AN.iii.368 and Vassakāra (AN.iv.18; DN.ii.72).<br><br>Several well-known suttas were preached on Gijjhakūṭa—e.g., the Māgha, Dhammika and Chaḷabhijāti Suttas, the discourse on the seven Aparihānīyadhammā, AN.iv.21f. the Mahāsāropama and Āṭānāṭiya Suttas (SN.ii.155; SN.ii.185; SN.ii.190; SN.ii.241; SN.iii.121; AN.ii.73; AN.iii.21; AN.iv.160).<br><br>Monks arriving late at Rājagaha would ask Dabbamallaputta-Tissa to find accommodation for them in Gijjhakūṭa, in order to test his capabilities. Vin.ii.76<br><br>Mention is made of several eminent monks who stayed at Gijjhakūṭa from time to time, such as Sāriputta, MN.iii.263AN.iii.300SN.ii.155 Ānanda, AN.iii.383 Mahā Kassapa, Anuruddha, Puṇṇa Mantāniputta, Upāli and Devadatta, SN.ii.155 Cunda, and Channa. SN.iv.55<br><br>Channa fell ill there, and ultimately committed suicide. Another monk is mentioned as having thrown himself down from Gijjhakūṭa because he was discontented with his life. Vin.iii.82<br><br> Moggallāna and Lakkhaṇa are reported to have stayed there, and to have seen many inhabitants of Rājagaha reborn in Gijjhakūṭa as petas. SN.ii.254Vin.iii.104AN.iv.75<br><br>The Mettiya-bhummajakas Vin.iii.167 and the Chabbaggiyas Vin.iii.82 were also in the habit of visiting the hill.<br><br>Several places are mentioned as having been visited by the Buddha during his sojourns on Gijjhakūṭa, and it may be inferred from accounts given of these visits that these places were within easy reach of the hill. Such, for example, are: the Paṭibhānakūṭa, SN.v.448 the Sītavana, where the Buddha went to visit Soṇa, AN.iii.374 the river Sappinī, on the banks of which lived various Paribbājakas, including Sarabha (AN.i.185; AN.ii.29; AN.ii.176), and the Paribbājakārāma of Udumbarika the residence of Nigrodha, near the Moranivāpa on the bank of the lake Sumāgadhā. DN.iii.39<br><br>The Sūkara-khatalena was on the slope of Gijjhakūṭa, and there the Buddha was once visited by Dīghanakha (SN.v.233; MN.i.497).<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUH2Zy88U7DYxgnqP_dLQP6PegKXrcq7tFLx5yx9DkghaYPN3CKugbXhVAStzihVo7rYwbnrEr870Wolo1nqN5VBWqq8FpJw_QVnAfFp9hVf_G5DoEuRdDZTw3UIUjXZ_7mF9eyKoDW-sVAbyuQB1hp6ZIXYZr698LBLmTJGKP3Dqhm6YNatatxGTScb5oFHOhOgzDQncfAFCTR7cjS8KE76Q1Wvg0brlggUbGCUl6Qd8Zy7kxcVJtHxEEYMUJvOL1RTc1tJpkHWQXgZXV-icVNHC1dr_3_78s6cFQCNwel_IEsj1yblhhHTBfUrhoR15zfDsq85wM8QC5fE5SNUCA\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUHmJQ1tDZgbL6xa9AXjFhpJu7TD-YYN41zU6Zl3KnZxsZyIPIFTW6_So1tVPALw9ur-OlhYFXrl1GEwBi_FN50l1-8kgoV6VvTunIOflxxMNru2bjZtfQ\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUF4Q-B9HL1f19ylawi4yEY-TcevIG0_a2cfZ5uu9Ey_d1YH3ssuCRQU4HseoZEf-QvGbP_-WN_n_MNxFh0dlbDU9Rl_RiimJKi0KaFYJa8M\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AFiHsUGKOXVd-Dfc53Ja5MZGMAYOnAWeLiMMvmKTN2OvqFC67mmRxjmG0dwApNBNllO57basZhB68J2NFJt9EiQgna_fGhVBlQZLgsxNA_rdr9kp_A\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />",

SN.i.105f.<br><br>Besides the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta mentioned above, several other suttas were preached by the Buddha while staying at Isipatana, among them:<br>- the Pañca Sutta SN.iii.66f. <br>- the Rathakāra or Pacetana Sutta AN.i.110f. <br>- the two Pāsa Suttas SN.i.105f. <br>- the Samaya Sutta AN.iii.320ff. <br>- the Kaṭuviya Sutta AN.i.279f.<br>- a discourse on the Metteyyapañha of the Parāyana AN.iii.399f. <br>- the Dhammadinna Sutta SN.v.406f. <br><br>Some of the most eminent members of the Saṅgha seem to have resided at Isipatana from time to time; among recorded conversations at Isipatana are several between Sāriputta and Mahākoṭṭhita (SN.ii.112f; SN.iii.167f; SN.iv.162f; SN.384ff). and one between Mahākoṭṭhita and Citta-Hatthisāriputta.

The Buddha stayed there on several occasions, and in the books are found records of various eminent persons who visited him there and of his conversations with them. Among such visitors are mentioned several Licchavi chiefs, Mahāli Otthatthaddha (DN.i.150ff;SN.i.230f;SN.iii.68f;AN.v.86f), Nandaka, SN.v.389 Sunakkhatta, MN.ii.252 Bhaddiya, AN.ii.190f. Sāḷha and Abhaya, AN.ii.200 all attended by numerous retinues; their senāpati, Sīha, who went with five hundred chariots, having only decided after much hesitation to see the Buddha; (AN.iii.38f;AN.iv.79;AN.iv.179ff) the Jaina Saccaka, whom the Buddha won only after much argumentation, as described in the Cūḷa- and the Mahā-Saccaka Suttas (MN.i.227ff;MN.i.237ff), the householder Ugga of Vesāli, acclaimed by the Buddha for the possession of eight eminent qualities (AN.iii.49;AN.iv.208f; SN.iv.109) the upāsaka Vāseṭṭha; AN.iv.258f. the two goddesses, daughters of Pajjunna, both known as Kokanadā; SN.i.29f and the brahmin Piṅgiyāni AN.iii.237f.<br>The Licchavis waited on the Buddha and ministered to him during his stay in the Kūṭāgārasālā, and it is said that they were of various hues: some blue, others yellow, etc. And Piṅgiyānī, seeing the Buddha shining in their midst, surpassing them all, once uttered the Buddha’s praises in verse, winning, as reward from the Licchavis, five hundred upper garments, all of which, be, in turn, presented to the Buddha AN.iii.239f. On one occasion, when the Buddha was preaching to the monks regarding the six spheres of sense contact, Māra arranged an earthquake to break the monks’ concentration, but failed to achieve his object. SN.i.112 It was here that the Buddha finally agreed to grant the request of the five hundred Sākyan women, led by Pajāpatī Gotamī, that they might be ordained as nuns. They had followed the Buddha hither from Kapilavatthu (AN.iv.274f; Vin.ii.253f). The Buddha gave Pajāpatī Gotamī, at her special request, a summary of his doctrine. AN.iv.280 It was also at the Kūṭāgārasālā that the Buddha uttered his prophecy as to the ultimate downfall of-the Licchavis. SN.ii.267f.<br>It was customary for the Buddha, when staying at the Kūṭāgārasālā, to spend the noonday siesta in the woods outside the Mahāvana, at the foot of a tree; visitors coming at that time would, if their desire to see him was insistent (DN.i.151;AN.iii.75) seek him there or be conducted to him. Sometimes he would express his desire to see no one during such a retreat, except the monk who brought him his food.<br>On one occasion the retreat lasted a fortnight, and on his return he found that a large number of monks had committed suicide as a result of a sermon he had preached to them before his retreat on the un-loveliness of the body. He then caused the monks to be assembled, and asked them to concentrate on breathing SN.v.320f. Sometimes the Buddha would walk from the Kūṭāgārasālā to places of interest in the neighbourhood—e.g., the Sārandada-cetiya AN.iii.167 and the Cāpāla-cetiya (SN.v.258;AN.iv.308f) It was from the Cāpāla-cetiya, during one of these walks that he gazed for the last time on Vesāli. He then returned to the Kūṭāgārasālā, where he announced that his death would take place within three months (DN.ii.119f;SN.v.258ff)<br>There was a sick ward attached to the monastery, where the Buddha would often visit the patients and talk with them. (SN.iv.210f;AN.iii.142)<br>The books also contain the names of others who stayed at the Kūṭāgārasālā when the Buddha was in residence—e.g., Ānanda, who was visited there by the Licchavis Abhaya and Panditakumāra;. AN.i.220 Anuruddha, who lived there in a forest hut; (SN.iii.116;SN.iv.380) Nāgita, the Buddha’s former attendant, and Nāgita’s nephew the novice Sīha; DN.i.151 also Cāla, Upacāla, Kakkaṭa, Kaḷimbha, Nikata, and Kaṭissaha, all of whom left the Kūṭāgārasālā and retired to the Gosiṅgasālavana, when the visits of the Licchavis to the Buddha became disturbing to their solitude.

As the Buddha suffered much from loss of blood, the monks took him on a litter to Maddakucchi, and from there to the Jīvakambavana, where he was treated by Jīvaka. Vin.ii.193f. It is said SN.i.27f. that seven hundred devas of the Satullapa group visited the Buddha there and told him of their great admiration for his qualities. Māra tried to stir up discontent in the Buddha, but had to retire discomfited (SN.i.110; DN.ii.116).<br><br>Once when Mahā Kappina was at Maddakucchi, doubts arose in his mind as to the necessity of joining the assembly of monks for the holding of uposatha, he himself being pure. The Buddha read his thoughts, appeared before him, and urged upon him the necessity of so doing. Vin.i.105<br><br>Maddakucchi was difficult of access; monks who came from afar late at night, wishing to put Dabba Mallaputta’s powers to the test, would often ask him to provide lodging there for them (Vin.ii.76; Vin.iii.159).",

She had it valued by goldsmiths, who declared that it was worth nine crores and one hundred thousand. She had the ornament put in a cart and sent round for sāle.
